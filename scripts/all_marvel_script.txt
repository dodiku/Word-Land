Thor
Wait for it. - Can I turn on the radio? - No. Jane, you can't keep doing this. The last seventeen occurrences, had been predictable - to the second. - Jane... You're an astrophysicist not some storm chaser. I'm telling you, there's a connection, between these atmosphere disturbances and my research. Erik, I... I wouldn't have asked you to fly out here, if I wasn't absolutely sure. Jane? I think you wanna see this. What is that? God! I thought you said, it was a subtle aurora. Go! Help me get down! - Get closer. - Yeah, right! Good one! Go! What are you doing? I'm not dying for six college credits! I think that was legally your fault. Get the first aid kit. Do me a favor and dont be dead! Please! Where did he come from? Once... mankind accepted a simple truth, that they were not alone in this universe. Some worlds, man believed to be home to their gods. Others, they knew to fear. From a Realm of cold and darkness, came the Frost Giants. Threatening to plunge the mortal world, into a new ice age. But humanity, would not face this threat alone. Our armies drove the Frost Giants, back into the heart of their own world. The cost was great. In the end, their king fell. And the source of their power, was taken from them. With the last great war ended, we withdrew from the other worlds, and returned home, to the realm eternal... Asgard. And here, we remain as the beacon of hope. Shining out across the stars. And though we have fallen into man's myths and legends, it was Asgard, and its warriors, that brought peace... to the universe. But the day will come, when one of you, will have to defend that peace. Do the Frost Giants still live? When I'm a king... I'll hunt the monsters down, and slay them all! Just as you did, Father. A wise king, never seeks out war, but... he must always be ready for it. - I'm ready, Father. - So am I. Only one of you can ascend to the throne. But both of you, were born to be kings. Oh, please. Yes! Thor Odinson, my heir, my first-born. So long entrusted with the mighty hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the heart of a dying star. It's power has no equal! as a weapon to destroy, or as a tool to build. It is a fit companion for a King. I have defended Asgard, and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms, in the time of the Great Beginning. And though the day has come for a new King... Do you swear to guard the Nine Realms? I swear. And do you swear to preserve the peace? I swear. Do you swear, to cast aside all selfish ambition, and to pledge yourself only to the good of the realms? I swear! Then on this day, I, Odin Allfather, will proclaim you... The Frost Giants... The Jotuns must pay for what theyve done! They have paid with their lives. The Destroyer did it's work, the Casket is safe, and all is well. All is well? They broke into the Weapons Vault! If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these relics... - But they didnt. - Well, I want to know why? I have a truce with Laufey, King of the Jotun. He just broke your truce! They know you're vulnerable. What action would you take? March into Jotunheim as you once did, teach them a lesson, break their spirits so theyll never dare-- try to cross our borders again! Youre thinking only as a warrior! - This was an act of war! - It was the act of but a few, - doomed to fail. - Look how far they got! We will find the breach in our defenses, and it will be sealed. - As King of Asgard... - But you're not King! Not yet. Its unwise to be in my company right now, brother. This was to be my day of triumph. It will come. In time. Whats this? If its any consolation, I think youre right. About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, about everything. If they found a way to penetrate the Asgard defenses once, whos to say they wont try again. Next time with an army. - Exactly! - Theres nothing you can do, without defying Father. No. No, no, no, no, no. I know that look! Its the only way to ensure the safety of our borders. - Thor, Its madness. - Madness? What sort of madness? Were going to Jotunheim. What? This isnt like a journey to Earth, where you summon a little lightning and thunder, and the mortals worship you as a god. This is Jotunheim. My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies, and took their Casket. We would just be looking for answers. It is forbidden! My friends, have you forgotten all that weve done together? Fandral, Hogun? Who led you into the most glorious of battles? You did. And Volstagg, to delicacies so succulent, you thought youd died and gone to Valhalla? - You did. - Yes. And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that-- a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors, this Realm has ever known? - I did. - True. But I supported you, Sif. My friends, Were going to Jotunheim. Leave this to me. Good Heimdall... You're not dressed warmly enough. I'm sorry? Do you think that you can deceive me? - You must be mistaken... - Enough! Heimdall, may we pass? Never has an enemy slipped my watch, until this day. I wish to know how that happened. Then tell no one where weve gone, until weve returned. Understand? What happened? Your silver tongue turn to lead? Be warned. I will honor my sworn oath, to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper. If your return threatens the safety of Asgard, Bifrost will remain closed to you. And youll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim. Couldnt you just leave the bridge open for us? To leave the bridge open, would unleash the full power of the Bifrost, and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it. - I have no plans to die today. - None do. We shouldnt be here. Let's move. Where are they? Hiding. As cowards always do. You've come a long way to die Asgardians. I am Thor Odinson. We know who you are. How did your people get into Asgard? The house of Odin is full of traitors. Do not dishonor my fathers name with your lies! Your father is a murderer and a thief. And why have you come here? To make peace? You long for battle. You crave it! You're nothing but a boy, trying to prove himself a man. This boy has grown tired of your mockery. Thor, stop and think. Look around you. We are outnumbered. Know your place, brother... You know not what your actions would unleash. I do. Go now, while I still allow it. We will accept your most gracious offer. Come on, brother. Run back home, little princess. Damn! Next! At least make it a challenge for me! Thats more like it! Dont let them touch you! Thor! - We must go! - Then go! Run! Thor! Heimdall! Open the bridge! Father! Well finish them together! Silence! Allfather. You look weary. Laufey. End this now. Your boy sought this out. Youre right. These are the actions of a boy. Treat them as such. You and I can end this, here and now. before theres further bloodshed. We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather. Hell get what he came for... war and death. So be it. Why did you bring us back? Do you realize what youve done? What youve started? I was protecting my home. You cannot protect your friends. How can you hope to protect a kingdom? Get him to the healing room! Now! There wont be a kingdom to protect, if youre afraid to act! The Jotuns must learn to fear me, just as they once feared you. Thats pride and vanity talking, Not leadership! Have you forgotten everything Ive taught you? - What of a warriors patience? - While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us. The old ways are done. Youd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls! Youre a vain, greedy, cruel boy! And you are an old man and a fool! Yes. I was a fool, to think you were ready. - Father. - Nay! Thor Odinson... You have betrayed the express command of your King. Through your arrogance and stupidity, you've opened these peaceful Realms, and innocent lives to the horror and desolation of war! You are... unworthy of these Realms! unworthy of your title! You're unworthy... of the loved ones, you have betrayed. I now take from you, your power! In the name of my father! And his father before! I, Odin Allfather, cast you out! Whosoever holds of this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor. I think that was legally your fault. Get the first aid kit. Do me a favor and dont be dead. Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I totally know CPR. Where did he come from? - You all right? - Hammer! Hammer! Yeah, we can tell youre hammered. Thats pretty obvious. Oh, my God! Erik, look at this. Weve got to move quickly before this all changes. Jane, we have to take him to the hospital. - Father! - Hes fine, look at him. Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the Bifrost! Hospital. You go, I'll stay. You! What Realm is this? Alfheim? Nornheim? New Mexico! You dare threaten me, Thor, with so puny a weapon! What? He was freaking me out. Next time you decide to taser someone, make sure he's already in the car, okay? Jane, come on. - Name? - He said it was "Thor". T-H-O-R. - And your relationship to him? - Ive never met him before. - Until she hit him with the car. - I grazed him. - But she tasered him. - Yes, I did. Hi. Just taking a little blood. How dare you attack the son of Odin! - I need some help! - You need help? Call security! Security to ER! We need assistance! Youre no match for the mighty... Huh. You dont think this was just a magnetic storm, do you? Look. The lensing around these edges, is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge. A what? I thought you were a science major. - Political Science. - She was the only applicant. An Einstein-Rosen Bridge is a theoretical connection, between two different points of space-time. It's a wormhole. Erik, look... What do you see? - Stars. - Yeah. But not our stars. See, this is the star alignment, for our quadrant, this time of year. And unless Ursa Minor decided to take the day off... these are someone elses constellations. Hey, check this out. No, it can't be. I think I left something at the hospital. Its not possible. - Oh, what the hell happened? - I don't wanna know. I just lost my most important piece of evidence. Typical. - Now what? - We find him. Did you see what he did in there? I'm not sure finding him is the best idea. Well, our data can't tell us-- what it was like to be inside that event, and he can. So, we're gonna find him. Okay. So you're gonna look all over New Mexico, right? Exactly. Oh, what? Im so sorry. I swear Im not doing this on purpose! # If you got a problem, you don't care what it is # # you'll need a hand, I can assure you this. # # I can help. # # I got two strong arms, I can help. # # It would sure do me good # # to do you good Let me help # Come on, pick it in now! Did it work? Sir... weve found it. You know, for a crazy, homeless person, he's pretty cut. Hey, sorry I tased you! Excuse me, excuse me! - Umm. - What is this? Oh... My ex. Good with patience and bad with relationships. Uh... They're the only clothes I had that would fit you. - They will suffice. - You're welcome. This mortal form has grown weak. I need sustenance! We should never have let him go. There was no stopping him. At least hes only banished, not dead. Which is what wed all be if that guard, hadnt told Odin where wed gone. How did the guard even know? I told him. What? I told him to go to Odin after wed left. He should be flogged for taking so long. We should have never reached Jotunheim. - You told the guard? - I saved our lives. And Thors. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did. Loki... you must go to the Allfather, and convince him to change his mind! And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. Hes arrogant, hes reckless, hes dangerous! You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King? He may speak of the good of Asgard, but hes always been jealous of Thor. We should be grateful to him. He saved our lives. Laufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin. A master of magic could bring three Jotuns into Asgard. Lokis always been one for mischief, but youre talking about something else entirely. Stop! - Am I cursed? - No. What am I? Youre my son. What more than that? The Casket wasnt the only thing, you took from Jotunheim that day, was it? No. In the aftermath of the battle, I went into the Temple, and I found a baby. Small for a giants offspring, abandoned, suffering, left to die. Laufeys son. Laufeys son... Yes. Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun blood. Why would you take me? - You were an innocent child. - No. You took me for a purpose, what was it? Tell me! I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day, bring about an alliance, bring about a permanent peace, - ... through you. - What? But those plans no longer matter. So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me. Why do you twist my words? You could have told me what I was from the beginning. - Why didnt you? - You are my son. I wanted only to protect you from the truth. What? Because I...I...I... I'm the monster that parents tell their children about at night? - Dont... - You know, it all makes sense now! Why you favored Thor all these years. Because no matter how much you claim to love me, you could never have a Frost Giant, sitting on the Throne of Asgard! Guards! Guards, please help! How'd you get inside that cloud? Also how could you eat an entire box of Pop Tarts, and still be this hungry? This drink, I like it. - I know, it's great, right? - Another! Sorry, Izzy. Little accident. - What was that? - It was delicious. I want another. Well, you could have just said so! - I just did. - No. I mean ask nicely. I meant no disrespect. All right. Well, no more smashing. Deal? - You have my word. - Good. The usual, please, Izzy. You missed all the excitement out at the crater. Theyre saying some kind of satellite landed out in the desert. Yeah, we were having a good time with it, Untill the Feds showed up. Excuse me, did you say there was a satellite crash? Yeah. Oh, my God! This is going on Facebook. Smile! What did it look like, the satellite? Well, I dont know nothing about satellites. But it was heavy. Heavy. Nobody could lift it. They said it was radioactive. I had my hands all over it. - Which way? - Oh. Fifty miles west of here. But I wouldn't waste my time. Looked like the whole Army was coming in when we left! - Where are you going? - Fifty miles west of here. - Why? - To get what belongs to me. - Oh, so you own a satellite now? - It's not what they say it is. Well, what ever it is, the government seems to think it's theirs. So, you just intend to go in there and take it? Yes. If you take me there now, Ill tell you everything you wish to know. - Everything? - Yes. All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. Myeu-muh? Whats Myeu-muh? Can I have a word, Jane? Please dont do this. You saw what I saw last night. This is no coincidence. We have to find out what's in that crater. But I'm not talking about the crater. I'm talking about him. - But he's promising us answers. - Hes delusional! Listen to what he's saying. He's talking about Mjolnir, and Thor and Bifrost! It's the stories I grew up with as a child. I'm just gonna drive him. That's it! He's dangerous, Jane. I'm sorry. But I can't take you. Then this is where we say goodbye. Uh... Thank you! Jane Foster, Erik Selvig, Darcy. Farewell. Alright. Back to work. Hey! Thats my stuff! What the hell is going on here? Ms. Foster, Im Agent Coulson, with SHIELD. Is that suppose to mean something to me? - You cant do this! - Jane. Jane. This is a lot more serious than you realize. Let it go. Let it go? This is my life! Were here investigating a security threat. We need to appropriate your records, and all your atmospheric data. By "appropriate" you mean "steal"? Here. This should more than compensate you for your trouble. I cant just buy replacements of RadioShack! I made most of this equipment myself! Then Im sure you can do it again. And Im sure I can sue you, for violating my constitutional rights! I'm sorry, Ms. Foster. But were the good guys. So are we! I'm on the verge of understanding something extraordinary. And everything I know about this phenomenon, is either in this lab, or in this book, and you can't just take this with... - Hey! - Jane! Easy! Easy! Thank you for your cooperation. Years of research, gone. They even took my iPod. - What about the backups? - They took our backups. They took the backups of our backups. They were extremely thorough. Just downloaded like thirty songs onto there. Could you please, stop with your iPod! Who are these people? I knew this scientist. a pioneer in gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up, and... he wasn't heard from again. They're not gonna do that to us. - I'm gonna get everything back. - Come on, please! Let me contact one of my colleagues. He's had some dealings with these people before. Ill email him and maybe he can help. They took your laptop, too. All-Father, we must speak with you urgently! My friends. Where's Odin? Father has fallen into the Odinsleep. Mother fears he may never awaken again. We would speak with her. She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your urgent matter to me. Your King. My King, we would ask that you end Thor's banishment. My first command can not be to undo the Allfathers last. Were on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people need a sense of continuity, in order to feel safe in these difficult times. All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard. Yes, of course. Good, then you await for my word. If I may, beg the indulgence of your majesty, - to perhaps reconsider... - We're done! I need a horse! We don't have horses. Just dogs, cats, birds. Then give me one of those, large enough to ride. Hey, you still need a lift? I've never done anything like this before. Have you ever done anything like this before? Many times. But you're brave to do it. Well, they just stole my entire life's work. I don't really have much left to lose. - But you're clever. - Thanks. Far more clever than anyone else on this Realm. Realm? Realm? - You think me strange? - Yeah, I do. Good strange, or bad strange? I'm not quite sure yet. I'm sorry. But who are you? Really? You'll see soon enough. You promised me answers. What you seek, it's a bridge. Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge? More like a rainbow bridge. God, I hope you're not crazy. I never get used to seeing him like this. But hes put it off for so long now. But I fear... - How long will it last? - I don't know. This time, it's different. We were unprepared. So why did he lie? He kept the truth from you, so that you would never feel different. You are our son, Loki. And we your family. We mustn't lose hope that your father will return to us. And your brother. What hope is there for Thor? There's always a purpose to everything your father does. This tube is a satellite crash? If they would've hauled the wreckage away, they wouldn't built a city around it. - Youre going to need this. - What? Wait, why? Now stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I will return the items they've stolen from you. - Deal? - No! Look whats down there! You think you're just gonna walk in, - grab our stuff, and walk out? - No. I'm gonna fly out. Sir, feed from the keyhole. Can barely penetrate the cloud cover. Techs barely working as it is, with all the interference, that things giving off. And weve got a commercial aircraft coming in right over us, Southwest Airlines Flight 5434. Reroute it, like all the others. Hold a sec... we've got something outside the fence, west side. DeLancey, Jackson, west side perimeter, go check it out. DeLancey, Jackson, report. Agent down! Weve got a perimeter breach! Youve reached Dr. Erik Selvig. Please leave me a message. Hi, Erik. It's me. Don't worry, I'm fine. But... just in case you dont hear from me in the next hour, just come by the crater site and try to find me, okay? I did exactly what you told me not to. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Bye! - You two, follow me! - All the squad, move! Open the gate! He breached our tunnel! Negative, negative! Place is locked on! I need eyes up high. With a gun. Pulling North! So, what have we got? There's a mass of electromagnetic surge coming of that thing. Systems are barely coping. Barton. Talk to me. Do you want me to slow him down, sir? Or you're sending in more guys for him to beat up? I'll let you know. Youre big. Fought bigger. You better call it Coulson, cause I'm starting to root for this guy. - Last chance, sir! - No, wait! I wanna see this. Why?! Alright, shows over. Ground units, move in. He committed a crime! He's in jail! - I can't just leave him there! - Why? - You didn't see what I saw! - Look! Look! It's Myeu-muh. - Where'd you find this? - The children's section. I just wanted to show you how silly his story was. But you're the one who's always pushing me, to chase down every possibility, every alternative! I'm talking about science, not magic! Well magic's just science that we don't understand yet, - Arthur C. Clarke. - Who wrote science fiction. - A precursor to science fact! - In some cases, yes. Well, if there is an Einstein-Rosen Bridge, then there's something on the other side. And advanced beings could have crossed it! Oh, Jane... A primitive culture like the vikings ... might have worshiped them as deities. Yes, yes, exactly! Thank you! You made my men, some of the most highly trained professionals in the world, look like a bunch of minimum wage mall cops. That's hurtful. In my experience, it takes someone who's received similar training, to do what you did to them. Why don't you tell me, where you received your training? Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan? You know, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type. Where was it? South Africa? Certain groups pay very well for a good mercenary like you. Who are you? One way or another we'll find out what we need to know. We're good at that. Don't go anywhere. Loki? what are you doing here? I had to see you. What's happened? Tell me? Is it Jotunheim? Let me explain to father. Father is dead. What? Your banishment. The threat of a new war. It was too much for him to bear. You mustn't blame yourself. I know that you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen. So cruel to put the hammer within your reach, knowing that you could never lift it. The burden of the throne has fallen to me now. Can I come home? The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile. Yes, but... couldn't we find a way to... Your mother, has forbidden your return. This is goodbye, brother. I'm so sorry. No. I am sorry. Thank you for coming here. Farewell. Goodbye. Goodbye? I just got back. Sir... hes got a visitor. - His name is Donald Blake? - Doctor Donald Blake. You have dangerous co-workers, Doctor Selvig. He was distraught when he found out, that you'd taken all of our research. That was years of his life, gone! You can understand how a man can go off like that. A big faceless organization like yours, coming in with their jack-booted thugs and... That's how he put it. That still doesn't explain, how he managed to tear through our security. Steroids! He's a bit if a fitness nut. Sir? It says here that he was an M.D. Well, he is! Or he was. He switched careers and became a physicist. A brilliant physicist. He's a... he's a wonderful man. He's a man in pain. Oh, Donny, Donny, Donny! There you are! Its gonna be all right, Im taking you home, now. Doctor Selvig? Just keep him away from the bars. I will. - Where are we going? - To get a drink. Follow them. You know, I had it all backwards. I had it all wrong. Was that a bad thing, finding out that you don't have all the answers? You start asking the right questions. For the first time in... in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. Anyone who's ever going to find his way in this world, has to start by admitting, he doesn't know where the hell he is. Thank you, for what you've done. No, don't thank me. I only did it for Jane. Her father and I taught at University together. He was a good man. He never listened. Neither did I. My father was trying to teach me something. But I was too stupid to see it. I don't know if you're delusional, or if you're putting some kind of con. I don't care. I just care about her. I've seen the way she looks at you. I swear to you, I mean her no harm. Good. In that case, I'll buy you another round. And you'll leave town tonight. Two boilermakers! Kill him. After all I've done for you? So you're the one who showed us the way into Asgard. That was just a bit of fun really. To ruin my brother's big day. And to protect the realm from his idiotic rule for a while longer. I will hear you. I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into Odin's chambers and you can slay him where he lies. Why not kill him yourself? I suspect that the Asgardians would not take kindly to a King, who had murdered his predecessor. Once Odin is dead, I will return the casket to you. And you can return Jotunheim to all it's uh... glory. I... accept. What troubles you, Gatekeeper? I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim, but could neither see you or hear you. You were shrouded from me, like the Frost Giants had entered this Realm. Perhaps your senses have weakened, after your many years of service. Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide, that which he does not wish me to see. You have great power, Heimdall. Did Odin ever fear you? - No. - And why is that? Because he is my King. And I'm sworn to obey him. He was your King. And you are sworn to obey me now. Yes? Yes. Then you'll open the Bifrost to no one. Until I have repaired the damage that my brother has done. Oh, my God! Is he okay? Hes fine. Not injured at all. - I'm Sorry, my friend. - What happened? We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud. Put him on the bed. Oh, I still dont think youre the God of Thunder. But you ought to be. Are these your chambers? Uh... its more of a temporary living situation. Oh, I'm sorry. I dont usually have guests. Actually... We never had guests. That's not the right place for it. I'm so sorry. - Can we go outside? - Yes, of course. I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep, or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data, or when Darcy's driving me crazy. I come up here a lot actually, now that I think about it. I'm really glad you're safe. You've been very kind to me. I have been far less grateful than you deserve. Well, I hit you with my car a couple times, so I think that kind of even things out. Perhaps I had it coming. Oh, my God! - I don't believe it! - It was all I could get back. I'm sorry, it's not as much as I promised. No! No! This is great! This is... I don't have to start from the scratch now. Thank you. What's wrong? SHIELD, whatever they are. They're going to do everything in their power, to make sure this research never sees the light of day. No, Jane. Listen to me, you must not give up. You must finish what you started. - Why? - Because you're right. Here, look. You're ancestors called it magic, and you call it science. Well, I come form a place, where they're one and the same thing. What is that? My father, explained it to me like this, that your world is one of the Nine Realms of the cosmos. Linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil. The worlds tree. Now you see it everyday without realizing. The images glimpsed through, what did you call it? This... this hooble telescope. - Hubble. - Hubble telescope. Tell me more. So, the Nine Realms. Now there is Midgard, which is earth. There's Alfheim, Vanaheim, Jotunheim and Asgard. And that's were I come from. Thank you, Jane. Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne, Asgard on the brink of war, Yet you've managed to consume, four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef and two casks of ale! Shame on you! Don't you care! Do not mistake my appetite for apathy! Stop it! Both of you! Stop. We all know what we have to do. We must go. We must find Thor. - It's treason. - To hell with treason. It's suicide. Thor would do the same for us. Now, shh! Heimdall might be watching. Heimdall demands your presence. Were doomed. You would defy the commands of Loki, our King, Break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring Thor back? - Yes. - Good! So you'll help us? I am bound by honor to our King. I cannot open the bridge to you. - Complicated fellow, isn't he? - Now what do we do? Look! What the hell was that? I dont know, sir. We got massive energy readings out of nowhere, and then they just disappeared. Fifteen miles due northwest. Lets go take a look. - Thank you. - Thank you. You're very welcome. Base to team two, we've got activity outside the town. Stay on your target. Ensure my brother does not return! Destroy everything! Mom? Is there a Renaissance Faire in town? - Call it in. - Yeah. Base, we've got... Xena, Jackie Chan, and Robin Hood It's a beautiful theory, Jane. You won't be able to convince... the scientific community of any of it. Not without hard evidence. Found you! My friends! This is good! This is good! - I don't believe it! - Oh, excuse me. Lady Sif, and the warriors three. My friends, I have never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come. We're here to take you home! You know I can't go home. My father is... dead because of me. I must remain in exile. Thor... your father still lives. Tell me, Loki, how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard? You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of this realm? There are secret paths between the worlds, to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am king. And I say, for your act of treason, you are relieved of your duties as Gatekeeper. And no longer citizen of Asgard. Then I need no longer obey you. Get somebody from Linguistics down here. Was somebody else coming? - Is that one of Starks? - I don't know. That guy never tells me anything. Hello! Youre using unregistered weapons technology. Identify yourself. Here we go. Incoming! Jane, you have to leave. - What are you gonna do? - I'm staying here. Thor is gonna fight with us. My friends, I'm just a man. I'll only be in the way, or worse get one of you killed. But I can help get these people to safety. Well, if you're staying, then so am I. - We'll need some time. - You'll have it. Okay, move it people! Everybody, out! Use the backdoor! Go, hurry! You can eat later! Keep it distracted. For Asgard!! Fall back! Go, now! Run! Sif, you've done all you can. No! I will die a warrior's death. Stories will be told of this day. Live, and tell those stories yourself. Now, go! You must return to Asgard. You have to stop Loki. What about you? Dont worry, my friends. I have a plan. Come on. We need to fall back. Come on! Come on. Wait! What's he doing? Brother, whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am truly sorry. But these people are innocent. Taking their lives will gain you nothing. So take mine... and end this. No! - It's over. - No. It's not over. - I mean, you're safe. - We're safe. It's over. No. No. Whosoever holds of this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor. Jane! - No. No. - Let's go! Now! No! Oh. My. God. So is this how you normally look? More or less. It's a good look. We must go to the Bifrost site. I would have a word with my brother. Excuse me! Donald, I don't think you've been completely honest with me. Know this, son of Coul. You and I, we fight for the same cause, the protection of this world. From this day forward you can count me as your ally, if, you return the items you have taken from Jane. - Stolen! - Borrowed. Of course you can have your equipment back. You're gonna need it to continue your research. Would you like to see the bridge we spoke of? Uh... sure. Wait! I need to debrief you! Welcome to Asgard. Heimdall! Open the Bifrost! Heimdall. Heimdall. He doesn't answer. Then were stranded. Heimdall! If you can hear me, we need you now! Heimdall! we need you now! Heimdall! I must go back to Asgard. But I give you my word, I will return for you. Deal? Deal. Get him to the healing room! Leave my brother to me. It's said, you can still hear and see what transpires around you. I hope it's true. So that you may know, your death came at the hand... of Laufey. And your death came by the son of Odin. Loki, you saved him. I swear to you mother, that they will pay for what they have done today. Loki! Thor! I knew you'd return to us. Why don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends! - To kill me! - What? Well, I must have been enforcing father's last command. You're a talented lier, brother. Always have been. It's good to have you back. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to destroy Jotunheim. You can't stop it. The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart. Jane? Why have you done this? To prove to father, that I am a worthy son! When he wakes, I will have saved his life. I will have destroyed that race of monsters. And I will be true heir to the throne! You can't kill an entire race! Why not? And what is this newfound love for the Frost Giants? You? who could have killed them all with your bear hands. - I've changed. - So have I. Now, fight me. I never wanted the throne! I only ever wanted to be your equal. I will not fight you, brother! I'm not your brother. - I never was! - Loki, this is madness! Is it madness? Is it? Is it? Come on, what happened to you on earth that turned you so soft? Don't tell me it was that woman? Oh! It was! Well, maybe when we're finished here, I'll pay here a visit myself! Thor! Brother, please! Enough! Look at you. The mighty Thor! With all your strength! And what good does it do you now? Do you hear me, brother? There's nothing you can do! What are you doing? If you destroy the bridge, youll never see her again! Forgive me, Jane. I could have done it, father! I could have done it! For you! For all of us! No, Loki. Loki, no! No. It's gone. And then, with a mighty bellow, I flew into the giant metal beast and laid it low... Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge... As a matter of fact, falling down was a tactic. My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss. How is he? He mourns for his brother. And... he misses her. The mortal. You'll be a wise king. There will never be a wiser king than you. Or a better father. I have much to learn. I know that now. But some day, perhaps, I shall make you proud. Youve already made me proud. So, earth is lost to us? No. There is always hope. Can you see her? Yes. I have the particle detectors. Darcy, do you have the SHIELD's satellite codes? Yeah. Have you seen my taser? How is she? In the car. Come on, Jane. She searches for you. Doctor Selvig? So, you're the man behind all this? It's quite a labyrinth. I was thinking, they're taking me down here to kill me. I've been hearing about the New Mexico situation. Your work has impressed a lot of people who are much smarter than I am. I have a lot to work with. The Forster theory, a gate to another dimension. It's unprecedented. Isn't it? Legend tells us one thing, history another. But every now and then, we find something that belongs to both. What is it? Power, doctor. If we can figure out how to tap it, maybe unlimited power. Well, I guess that's worth a look. Well, I guess that's worth a look.
Outside of the world you know,
there exists the realm eternal...
...Asgard.
The shining light of the Nine Worlds.
Asgard is home to the gods.
All of whom bow down
before the all father...
...Odin.
Odin's life blood flows through Asgard,
and Asgard is Odin.
His power is all and he keeps
the Asgardian realm safe.
But once each winter
the all father must rest...
...and enter the Odin sleep.
While Odin slumbers, his absence
leaves Asgard vulnerable.
And this is when the wicked
descend upon his kingdom.
For seven days
an onslaught of trolls,...
...giants, dark elves and demons...
...seek to take control
of the Nine Worlds.
But they are
eternally defeated by him!
My arrogant, oafish,
brute of a step brother...
...Thor.
I don't understand.
Where... Where am I?
Hear me, human.
You have been brought to Asgard,
because in all the universe...
...only you have ever brought
near defeat to the mighty Thor.
What?
I... I couldn't.
Not thee, Bruce Banner.
You are but a snivelling, sad creature.
I speak of your other half.
I speak of the Hulk.
There is one day left of the Odin sleep.
The cycle is nearly complete.
As always the Asgardians will emerge
victorious against the siege of darkness.
My brother will seek peace,
and then...
Then I shall destroy him.
Verily thee must say that was
far better than the last winter.
Tell us, Volstagg, are you going to
dispatch that troll beneath you...
...or you saving him for dinner?
That all depends on how much
mead I partake in.
Did my ears deceive me?
Did Hogun the Grim make a joke?
And here we thought
you are still in a foul mood...
...because you didn't
get to slay a frost giant.
I've still slain more than thee, Fandral.
Well we shall see
whom the maidens reward more.
In mere hours the all father will awaken
and then we may rejoice.
Your Lady Sif,
would know what vexes thee.
Aye, we won the day.
All is well in the realm of Asgard.
- But only until the next Odin sleep.
- It is, as it has always been.
We must learn to savour
the moments of peace.
And accept the cycle of death?
How many of our brothers and sisters
have fallen to this madness?
Must we be chained
to this eternal struggle?
Be careful what you wish for my love.
When the cycle does break,
when things do change...
...then comes the end of days.
Then comes Ragnarok.
Perhaps our fates are not ours to choose.
Thee come, let us return to
my fathers palace...
...and prepare for his awakening.
Please, I'm begging you.
Don't do this.
I've fought all my life
to keep the Hulk inside.
You don't know
the destruction he can cause.
Don't know? You fool.
I'm counting on it.
Look at you, so weak.
Where it not for you inside the Hulk's mind,
suppressing his power...
...he would rule Midgard
with his rage.
I won't let him out.
I won't let you do this.
You won't let me?
How amusing you mortals are.
Now let me see if I recall correctly.
It is anger that unleashes the beast?
I seem to have forgotten
the frailty of mortals.
Look Amora, I do believe
he's going to weep.
No, that is impossible.
Now.
And so begins the end of Thor.
Oh, yeah. What do you think, thee Balder?
One last troll with dreams of conquest?
Perhaps.
Come Hogun, Fandral.
Let us given to this scoundrel
the gift of battle.
The creature's power is incredible.
Take care Loki.
My spell bonds you to the creature...
...and while you are master to it
I can feel him fighting you.
You have to listen to me.
It can't be controlled.
Do not try my patience worm.
Lest I turn my attentions to thee.
You are no troll, monster.
It is Balder's horn.
But this is not right.
- Asgard's enemies are all defeated.
- And yet the alarm has sounded.
Stay at Odin's side.
Should I fail to meet this threat,
you must protect him.
But if Thor should fall,
what hope has Asgard?
You will have to kill me monster...
...for I shall not yield.
Thor, the creature like nothing
I've ever seen.
Aye, my friend.
This is no immortal evil that we face now.
The Hulk has come to Asgard.
Dr. Banner, can you hear me
inside the beast?
Why have you come here?
Why to kill you of course,
dear step brother.
Loki?
I have waited an eternity for this.
To crush you with my bare hands.
To match your might.
To feel your life fade away...
...as my hands
wrap around your throat.
Never!
Come to your new master, Mjolnir...
...and let us smite my step brother.
For there are none stronger than Loki now.
Rise cursed hammer!
Loki enough.
Your own rage fuels the beast.
I can feel the spell breaking.
I will have this hammer!
Neh, you will have it's thunder!
For Odin!
For Asgard!
The monster, it is raging carnage.
It has shattered the spell.
The Hulk is free.
Will thou yield, Loki?
Truly this is the best of both worlds.
I need not control the beast
to enjoy it's wrath.
Goodbye, brother.
This...
This is not what I wanted.
There's no going back Amora.
After all, if not for your
black broken heart...
...none of this
would have been possible.
You don't know what you've done.
With no one to bring the Hulk in,
he'll tear down your entire world.
I find your prattling useless mortal,
just as you are now useless to me.
For Odin!
For Asgard!
Thor, my love.
I... I was angered when you chose
Sif over me, I did not...
I wanted thou love, not your death.
Please.
Please come back to me.
- Amora?
- Yes my love?
Where is Loki?
What is that monster doing?
He travels towards Odin.
Loki, I would have words with thee.
No, you were at Hela's door,
I defeated you.
You! You dare cross the god of...
The Hulk will be send back to Midgard
and then you will answer to Odin.
Fine, take the creature.
It provided me with amusement enough.
Seeing it pummel you nion to death.
Loki, you fool.
You killed him.
Do you know what you've done?
Because the mortal died here,
Hela claimed his soul.
Without his soul, I cannot
return him to Midgard.
Without Bruce Banner,
the Hulk cannot leave Asgard.
Valkeries, warriors!
Your seats in Valhalla are promised.
Protect Odin with your lives!
For Asgard!
I saw the beast's eyes brother.
It will not stop until all of Asgard
is destroyed, until Odin is broken.
You have brought a new Ragnarok
down upon us all.
It's possible I made
a poor choice.
Amora, I need you by Odin's side.
Protect him along with Lady Sif.
As you wish.
Loki, you will send whatever dark forces
you have left to battle the Hulk.
Then you and I,
we go out to help destiny.
Rest your weapons, shield men.
I've come to aid thee in Odin's defence,
at Thor's request.
His request you say?
More likely his penance, witch.
No doubt he saw your hand
in this attack.
A punishment more cruel
than you can imagine, cow.
Loki, the god of mischief
bids you death mortal creature.
Long have I wished
never to see this realm.
I always forget what a busy time
the Odin sleep is for my daughter.
Does thou see any newly arrived
friends here, brother?
Have a care, Loki,
lest thee stay here.
Where am I?
No, this doesn't make any sense.
Bruce?
Are you okay?
Betty?
I... I thought...
I don't understand.
- I was alone, and then...
- You're not alone Bruce.
Not any more.
Daddy!
Come play with me.
Hail, Hela, goddess of the dead.
We seek an audience.
The sons of Odin
risk much entering my realm.
The Nine Worlds of Asgard
are in great peril, mistress...
...including Hell and Niflheim.
A new Ragnarok is upon us
and we need your help.
We need Bruce Banner.
The mortal's soul is mine, Asgardian.
As yours nearly was this very day.
And may well be again.
You would risk everything
for the sake of one soul?
Just as you would, Odin's son.
But you do not have one soul daughter.
You have half a soul.
You have Bruce Banner.
You need the Hulk
to complete your prize.
Are you alright?
I feel...
I feel great.
I can't imagine anything better.
Bruce Banner.
Awake from this dream.
Betty?
Betty? Where are you?
The world of the living has need of you.
Who are you?
What do you want with me?
Not I, he.
Friend Banner,
for the sake of all of Asgard...
...you must become the Hulk once more.
Betty? What?
Where? Where is...
No.
No!
No. No, you can't ask me to do that.
I finally had peace.
You don't know what your asking.
Your time in Hell certainly has not
made you less of a worm, mortal.
Bruce Banner, I know
thee to be a man of honour.
I know thee to be a hero.
The lives at stake are not
your concern, not even human.
But I ask you anyway,
be that hero now.
No, I can't.
Die beast!
The Hulk's soul
is rightfully yours, daughter.
Take it, bring the Hulk to hell.
Merge the two halves
of his soul and claim him.
I will not force you to forsake
the rewards of the after life...
...but you must be whole.
- No, I won't.
You don't understand.
No!
Curse you Loki, for convincing me
to bring this creature to my realm.
Stay thy hand Hela.
We shall retrieve the Hulk.
We? The Hulk's fists have addled
your mind thunderer?
Fight with me brother, or die alone.
Not much of a threat,
considering we're already in hell.
Have that thee!
My apologies.
I was enjoying the performance.
Let them go.
I'm the one you want.
Come on.
Hulk tired.
You called him weak, Loki.
But there is more strength and courage
in that man than you will ever know.
This soul is too dangerous
to keep in Hell...
...and to valuable to lose to Valhalla.
I will return him to Midgard.
Enough of this ridiculousness.
To think that Loki,
prince of darkness,...
...should waste his time
with defending Asgard.
Nay brother, we leave together.
For you still have much to answer for.
Indeed you both do.
For today Hela has relinquished a soul...
...and she demands one in exchange.
You may try to take my soul death Goddess,
but I will make you fight for it.
And your realm has suffered
much already this day.
You speak the truth.
So I shall take his soul instead.
What?
Thor!
Thor, I've helped you. I...
- I could fight you for Loki's soul.
- Will you?
No.
He is my father.
His stay will not be eternal.
But know this Odin's son,
your soul will be mine.
And I will keep it forever.
Your fate is inescapable.
We shall see.
Thus the cycle begins anew.
Asgard is safe once again,
defended to the end by it's heroes.
I am proud of each of you
that stand before me.
The day was saved by loyalty and sacrifice.
We honour those who fought beside us.
Those who are know longer with us.
And we defy those
who would see us brought to ruin.
And while the rewards of Valhalla
await all of Asgard's heroes,...
...this day we honour a hero of Midgard.
A mortal who sacrificed everything
for a land not his own.
This day a human showed the gods
what legends are made of.
Hail the mortal, Bruce Banner.
I feel like you're driving me to
court martial. This is crazy.
What did I do? I feel like you're
gonna pull over and snuff me.
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forest...
- We can talk, sir.
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
No, you intimidate them.
Dear God, you're a woman!
I honestly, I couldn't have called that.
I mean, I would apologize, but isn't
that what we're going for here?
I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.
Well you have actually excellent
bone structure there. I'm kinda...
having a hard time not looking
at you now. Is that weird?
C'mon, it's OK, laugh. Hey!
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.
It is true you went 12-for-12 with
last year's Maxim cover models?
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no. March and I
had a scheduling conflict,
but fortunately the Christmas
cover was twins. Anything else?
You're kidding me
with a hand up, right?
Is it cool if I take
a picture with you?
Yes, it's very cool.
I don't wanna see this
on your MySpace page.
Please, no gang signs.
No, throw it up, I'm kidding.
Yeah, peace! I love peace.
I'd be outta job with peace.
C'mon! Just click it, don't change
the settings, just click it.
What's going on?
Jimmy, stay with Stark!
Lie down!
Son of a bitch!
- Wait, wait, give me a gun!
- Stay here!
Tony Stark.
LAS VEGAS, 36 HOURS EARLIER
Visionary. Genius.
American patriot.
Even from an early age,
the son of legendary weapons
developer Howard Stark
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.
At age four, he built
his first circuit board.
At age six, his first engine.
And at seventeen, he graduated
Summa Cum Laude from MIT.
Then, the passing of a titan.
Howard Stark's life long friend
and ally Obadiah Stane,
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder.
Untill at age 21,
the prodigal son returns,
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.
With the keys to the kingdom,
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics,
satellite targeting.
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry,
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America and
her interests around the globe.
As liaison to Stark Industries,
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.
He is my friend and
he is my great mentor.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor
to present this year's Apogee
Award to Mr. Tony Stark!
Tony?
Thank you, Colonel.
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.
This is wonderful.
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.
But if I were Tony...
...I would tell you
how honored I feel,
and what a joy it is to receive
this very prestigious award.
Tony, you know,
the best thing about Tony...
...is also the worst thing -
he's always working.
C'mon!
We should just stay
till the morning.
- You are unbelievable!
- Oh, no. They roped you into this?
Nobody roped me into anything.
But they told me...
that if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you!
That's great. So when do we do it?
One more round. - There you go.
There it is. That was easy.
I'm so sorry. - Yeah, it's OK.
Wow, would you look at that?
That's... that's something else.
I don't have any of those
swooping around. All right, ride!
Give me a hand, will you?
OK, you too.
I don't blow on man's hands.
There it is! It's the Lieutenant
Colonel Rhodes' roll, and...
That's what happens.
Worse things have happened,
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?
- This is where I exit.
- Tomorrow don't be late.
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious.
- I know, I know.
Render unto Caesar that which
is Caesar's. There you go.
Mr. Stark! Excuse me!
Mr. Stark!
Christine Everheart,
Vanity Fair magazine.
Can I ask you a couple of
questions? - She's cute.
- She's alright? Hi.
- Hi.
Yeah. Okay, go.
You've been called the Da Vinci of
our time. What do you say to that?
Absolutely ridiculous.
I don't paint.
And what do you say to your other
nickname, the Merchant of Death?
That's not bad.
Let me guess... Berkeley?
Brown, actually.
Well, Ms. Brown.
It's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.
I guarantee you the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,
we'll start making bricks and
beams for baby hospitals.
Rehearse that much?
Every night in front of
the mirror before bedtime.
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you firsthand.
All I want is the serious answer.
Okay, here is serious.
My old man had a philosophy:
"Peace means having a bigger
stick than the other guy."
That's a great line, coming
from a guy selling the sticks.
My father helped defeat Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.
A lot of people, including
your professors at Brown,
would call that being a hero.
And a lot of people would
also call that war-profiteering.
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved by
advancing medical technology?
Or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?
All those breakthroughs:
military funding, honey.
Wow, did you ever lose an hour
of sleep your whole life?
I'd be prepared to
lose a few with you.
Good morning. It's 7 a.m.
The weather in Malibu is 72
degrees with scattered clouds.
The surf conditions are fair
with waist to sholder highlines,
high tide will be at 10:52 a.m.
MALIBU, CALIFORNIA
Tony? Hey, Tony!
You are not authorized to
access this area. - Jesus!
That's Jarvis, he runs the house.
I've got your clothes here, they've
been dry cleaned and pressed.
And there's a car
waiting for you outside
that will take you
anywhere you'd like to go.
You must be the famous
Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am.
After all these years, Tony still
has you picking up the dry cleaning?
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires.
Including occasionally taking out
the trash. Would that be all?
Give me the exploded view.
The compression in cylinder 3
appears to be low.
Note that.
- I'll try again later...
- Please don't turn down my music.
I'll keep you posted.
You are supposed to be half way
around the world right now.
- How did she take it?
- Like a champ.
Might've tried to
hustle me out of here.
Your flight was scheduled to
leave an hour and a half ago.
That's funny... I thought with
it being my plane and all,
that it would just wait
for me to get there.
I need to speak to you about couple of
things before I get you outta the door.
I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the
purpose of having your own plane
if it departs before you arrive?
Larry called, he's got another
buyer for the Jackson Pollock
in the wings, do you
want it, yes or no?
Is it a good representation
of his Spring Period?
No the "Springs" is actually the
neighborhood in East Hampton,
where he lived and worked,
not "spring" like the season.
I think it's a fair example...
I think it's incredibly overpriced.
I need it. Buy it, store it.
Okay... the MI commencement speech.
Is in June... please, don't
harange me about that stuff.
Well, they are haragning me,
so I'm gonna say yes...
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.
What are you trying to get rid
of me for? What, you got plans?
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.
I'm allowed to have
plans on my birthday.
It's your birthday. - Yes.
- I knew that. Already?
Yeah, isn't that strange,
it's the same day as last year.
Well, get yourself something
nice from me. - I already did.
- And?
- Oh, it was very nice.
Very tasteful.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.
You're welcome, Ms. Potts.
You're good! I thought
I've lost you back there.
You did, sir.
I took it across Mojave.
- Ah, I gotcha, I gotcha.
What's wrong with you?
- What?
Three hours! - I got caught
doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
Three hours. For three hours,
you got me standing here.
I'm waiting on you now.
Lets go. C'mon.
Wheels up! Rock and roll!
What're you reading?
- Nothing.
C'mon, sourpatch,
don't be mad.
I told you I'm not mad,
I'm indifferent, okay?
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.
- No need to apologize.
- I told him I was sorry but he...
I'm just indifferent right now.
You don't respect yourself,
so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.
- I'm just your babysitter,
and so, when you need your
diaper changed, thank you...
let me know and I'll
get you a bottle, okay?
Hey, heat up the sake, will you?
Thanks for reminding me.
I'm not talking... we're not drinking,
we're working right now.
And you are constitutionally
incapable of being responsible.
It would be irresponsible
not to drink.
I'm just talking about
the night cup. - Hot sake?
- Yes, two please.
- No, just...
I'm not drinking,
I don't want any.
That's what I'm talking about.
When I get up in the morning,
and I'm putting on my uniform,
you know what I recognize?
I see in that mirror that every
person that's got this uniform
will get my back! - Here we
go again. I'm not like you.
No, you don't have to be like me.
But you're more than... yes you are.
Will you excuse me,
I'm a little bit distracted here.
No, you can't be distracted
right now. Listen to me!
BAGRAM AIR BASE,
AFGHANISTAN
General.
Welcome, Mr. Stark.
We look forward to your
weapons presentation.
Is it better to be feared
or respected?
And I say, is it too much
to ask for both?
With that in mind, I humbly
present the crown jewel
of Stark Industries freedom line.
It's the first missile system
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.
They say the best weapon is
one you never have to fire.
I respectfully disagree.
I prefer the weapon you
only have to fire once.
That's how dad did it,
that's how America does it...
and it's worked out
pretty well so far.
Find an excuse to let
one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.
For your consideration,
the Jericho.
We throw one of these in with every
purchase of 500 million or more.
To peace!
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How did it go?
Went great, looks like it's
gonna be an early Christmas.
Hey, way to go, my boy.
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?
Why aren't you wearing
those pyjamas I got you?
Good night, Tony.
Hey Tony!
I'm sorry, this is the fun-vee.
The hum-drum-vee is back there.
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
What the hell did you do to me?
What I did?
What I did is to save your life.
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.
Here, wanna see?
I have a souvenir.
Take a look.
I've seen many wounds
like that in my village.
We call them the walking dead.
Because in takes about a week for
the balls to reach the vital organs.
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet.
Hooked up to a car battery.
And it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.
That's right. Smile!
We met once, you know.
At the technical
conference in Bern.
- Don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.
Where are we?
Come on, stand up.
Stand up.
Do as I do.
C'mon, put your hands up.
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?
Do you understand me?
Do as I do.
He says: "Welcome Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer
in the history of America."
He is honored.
He wants you to build a missile.
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.
This one.
I refuse.
Tony!
He wants to know
what you think.
I think he got a lot
of my weapons.
He says they have everything you
need to build a Jericho missile.
He wants you to make
the list of materials.
He says for you to start
working immediately,
and when you're done,
he will set you free.
No, I won't.
No, he won't.
I'm sure they're
looking for you, Stark.
But they will never find
you in these mountains.
Look...
What you just saw...
that is your legacy, Stark.
Your life's work in the
hands of those murderers.
Is that how you want to go out?
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?
Or are you going to do
something about it?
Why should I do anything?
They're gonna kill me, you...
Either way, if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.
Well then... this is a very
important week for you, isn't it?
If this is gonna be my workstation,
I want it well lit,
I want all of these tools.
Welding gear, I don't care if it's
acetylene or propane.
I need a soldering station,
I need helmets,
I need goggles,
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets
of precision tools.
How many languages do you speak?
A lot. But apparently
not enough for this place.
They speak arabic,
urdu, dari, pashto,
mongolian, farsi, russian.
Who are these people?
They are your loyal
customers, sir.
They call themselves
The Ten Rings.
You know, we might
be more productive
if you include me in the
planning proces? - Aha.
Okay. We don't need this.
What is that?
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.
We need at least 1.6,
so why don't you go break
down the other eleven.
What are they doing?
Working.
Careful. Careful, we only
get one shot at this.
Relax, I've steady hands.
Why do you think
you're still alive, huh?
What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.
- Yinsen... nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
Wow, that doesn't look
like a Jericho missile.
That's because it is a
miniaturized Arc reactor.
We got a big one powering
my factory at home.
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.
But what could it generate?
If my math is right,
and it always is...
three gigajoules per second.
That could run your heart
for the 50 lifetimes. - Yeah.
Or something big for 50 minutes.
This is our ticket outta here.
- What is it?
'Flying the mountain' look.
Impressive.
Shesh Besh.
Good roll.
Good roll.
You still didn't tell me
where you're from.
I'm from a small
town called Gulmira.
It's actually a nice place.
- You got a family?
- Yes.
And I will see them
when I leave here.
And you, Stark?
Nothing.
No.
So you're a man who has
everything... and nothing.
Doesn't look anything
like the photo.
Maybe he modified it.
- The tail doesn't seem right.
- Well, too bad.
Relax.
The bow and arrow once was the
pinacle of weapons technology.
It allowed the great Genghis Khan
to rule from the Pacific
to the Ukraine.
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great.
And four times the size
of the Roman empire.
But today,
whoever holds the latest
Stark weapons,
rules these lands.
And soon...
...it will be my turn.
Why did you fail me?
We're working on it.
Diligently.
I spared your life.
Is this how you repay me?
It's very complex.
We're trying hard.
On your knees.
You think I'm an idiot?
Tell me the truth.
We are working hard.
Open your mouth.
- What does he want?
- You think I'm a fool?
What is going on?
Tell me the truth.
We are working on Jericho.
What do you want,
a delivery date?
I need him.
He's a good assistant.
You have till tomorrow...
...to assemble my missile.
- Okay?
- Yes.
Can you move?
Say it again.
then 16 steps, left from
the door, four to the right.
Where is Stark?
He was here a moment ago.
Go find him!
Yinsen!
Yinsen!
Stark!
Say something.
He is speaking hungarian,
I don't...
- Speak hungarian.
- Okay...
What do you know?
- How did that work?
- Oh my goodness.
- It worked all right.
- What do I do?
- Let me finish this.
- Finish last powering sequence.
Okay.
Now! Tell me, tell me!
F 11. Tell me when you
see a progress bar.
It should be up right now.
Talk to me, tell me when
you see it. - I have it.
- Press Ctrl + I.
- Got it.
'Enter'. I, 'Enter'. Come over
here and button me up.
They are coming!
Doesn't need to look pretty,
just get it done.
They are coming.
Make sure that checkpoints are
clear before you follow me out, OK?
We need more time.
Okay.
I'm gonna go
buy you some time.
Stick to the plan!
Stick to the plan!
Yinsen!
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!
Stark.
Come on. We gotta go.
Move with me. C'mon, we got
a plan, we need to stick to it.
This was always the plan, Stark.
Come on, you're going to
go see your family again.
My family is dead.
I'm going to see them now, Stark.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I want this.
I want this.
Thank you for saving me.
Don't waste it.
Don't waste your life.
My turn.
Not bad.
How was the fun-vee?
Next time you ride with me, okay?
Watch it coming up here.
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.
Your eyes are red.
Few tears for your
long lost boss?
Tears of joy.
I hate job hunting.
Yeah, vacation's over.
Where to, sir?
Take us to the hospital, please.
- No. - No? Tony...
- You have to go to the hospital.
- I don't have to do anything.
I was in captivity for three months.
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger...
...and the other one...
- That's not going to happen.
It's not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.
Call for a press conference?
What on earth for?
Yeah, Hogan, drive.
Cheeseburger first.
Look at this!
Tony!
I thought you'll be
in a hospital.
Look at you!
Oh, burger, you had
to have a burger.
Did you get me one of those?
There was only one left,
I needed it.
Hey, look who's here!
- Ms. Potts?
- Yes.
May I speak with you
for a moment?
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.
I am not a reporter.
I'm agent Phil Coulson,
with the Strategic
Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and
Logistics Division.
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.
We've been approached
already by the DOD, FBI, CIA...
We are a separate division.
With a more specific focus.
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about
the circumstances of his escape.
- I'll put something in a book,
shell I? - Thank you.
Hey, would it be alright
if everyone sat down?
Will you sit down? That way
you can see me, and I can...
A little less formal...
What's up with the lovin'?
Don't look at me,
I don't know what he's up to.
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
I never got to say
goodbye to dad.
I never got to say
goodbye to my father.
There's questions that
I would've asked him.
I would've asked him how he felt
about what his company did...
...if he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.
Or maybe he was every inch of a man
we all remember from the newsreels.
I saw young Americans killed...
...by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.
And I saw that I had
become part of a system
that is comfortable with
zero-accountability.
What happened over there?
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that
I have more to offer
this world than just making
things that blow up.
And that is why, effective
immediately, I'm shutting down
the weapons manufacturing
division of Stark International...
...untill such a time,
as I can decide
what the future of
this company will be,
what direction it should take,
the one I'm comfortable with,
and is consistant with the highest
good of this country and the world.
What we should
take away from this...
...is that Tony's back!
And he's healthier than ever.
We are gonna have a little
internal discussion
and we'll get back to
you with a follow-up.
- Where is he?
- He's inside.
That... that went well.
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?
Your head?
What about my head?
What do you think the over-under
on a stock drop is gonna be?
- Optimistically? 40 Points?
- At minimum.
Tony, we're a
weapons manufacturer.
Obie, I just... I don't want
the body count to be up...
That's what we do. We're iron
mongers, we make weapons.
My name is on facade
of the building.
What we do keeps the world
from falling into chaos.
Not based on what I saw.
We're not doing a
good enough job.
We can do better, we're
gonna do something else.
Oh, like what? You want us
to make baby bottles?
I think we should take another
look into Arc Reactor technology.
Oh, come on. The Arc Reactor,
that's a publicity stunt!
Tony, c'mon! We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.
The Arc was never cost-effective.
We knew that before we built it.
Arc Reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?
- Maybe.
- Am I right?
We haven't had a breakthrough
in that, in what... 30 years.
That's what they say.
Could you have a
lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?
- Never mind who told me.
- Show me.
- Rhodey or Pepper.
- I wanna see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.
It works.
Listen to me, Tony.
We are a team,
do you understand?
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,
like your father and I.
I'm sorry I didn't give you a
heads up, okay? But if I had...
Tony, no more of this
'ready - fire - aim' business.
- Do you understand me?
- That was dad's line.
You gotta let me handle this.
We're gonna have to play whole
different kind of ball now.
We're gonna have to
take a lot of heat.
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.
Stark Industries. I've got one
recommendation. Ready, ready?
Sell, sell, sell!
Abandon ship!
Does the'Hindenburg'
ring any bells?
Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!
Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!
Pepper!
How big are your hands?
- What?
- How big are your hands?
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.
Hey!
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.
Let's see them.
Oh, wow, they are small.
Very petite, indeed.
I just need your
help for a sec.
Oh my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?
It was, it is now an antique.
This is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.
I was swapping it up
for an upgraded unit
and I just ran into a
little... speed bump.
Speed bump?
What's happening?
It's nothing,
it's just a little snag.
There's an exposed wire
under this device
and is contacting a socket wall
and is causing a little
bit of a short circuit.
What do you want me to do?
Put that on the table over
there. That is irrelevant.
I just want you to reach in...
and you're just gonna
gently lift the wire out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it should be fine.
It's just like an operation,
you just don't let it
touch the socket wall.
- What's Operation?
- It's just a game, never mind.
- Just gently lift the wire.
- Okay. - Okay? Great.
You know, I don't think
that I am qualified to do this.
No, no, you're fine.
You're the most capable,
qualified and trustworthy
person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
Cause I really need your help here.
- Oh, there's pus!
- It's not pus.
It's a plasmic discharge, it's from
the device, not from my body.
- It smells!
- Yeah, it does.
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?
- I got it.
Now don't let it touch...
...the sides, that's what I was
trying to tell you before.
Okay, now make sure that
when you pull it out,
you don't pull out the magnet
and the end of it. That was it...
...that you just pulled out.
- Oh God. OK, what do I do?
- Don't put it back in!
- What's wrong?
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac
arrest cause you yanked out...
- What? I thought you said this
was safe! - We gotta hurry.
Take this, you gotta switch,
real quick. - Okay, okay.
Tony, it's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna make this okay.
You gotta touch
that to base plate.
And make sure you...
Was that so hard?
That was fun, right?
I got it, I got it.
Nice.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.
Are you okay?
Don't ever, ever...
...ever ask me to do anything
like that ever again.
I don't have anyone but you.
Are we ready?
What do you want me
to do with this?
That? Destroy it.
Incinerate it.
You don't wanna keep it?
Pepper, I've been
called many things.
Nostalgic is not one of them.
- Would that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That would be all, Ms. Potts.
Hey butterfingers, come here.
What's all this stuff doing
on top of my desk?
That's my phone, that's
a picture of me and my dad...
Right there. In garbage.
All that stuff.
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?
I tell you, in my experience,
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump
a pilot's instinct,
his insight - that ability
to look into a situation
beyond the obvious
and discern its outcome.
Or pilot's judgement.
Colonel, it's... why not
a pilot without a plane?
Look who fell outta the sky!
Mr. Tony Stark.
Speaking about manned
or unmanned,
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong.
It's spring break,
just remember that.
Spring break 1987, that lovely
lady, what was his name?
Was it Ivan?
Don't do that, they'll believe it.
Don't do that.
Give us a couple
of minutes, you guys.
- I'm surprised.
- Why?
I swear I didn't expect to see
you walking around so soon.
I'm doing a little
better than walking.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Rhodey, I'm working
on something big.
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be part of it.
You're about to make a whole lotta
people around here real happy,
cause that little stunt at the
press conference, that was juicy.
This is not for the military.
I'm not... it's different.
What, are you humanitarian
now or something?
I need you to listen to me.
No, what you need is time
to get your mind right.
I'm serious.
It was nice seeing you, Tony.
Thanks.
- Jarvis, are you up?
- For you sir, always.
I'd like to open a new
project file, index as: Mark 2.
Shell I store this on the Stark
Industries' central database?
I don't know who to trust
right now. Till further notice,
why don't we just keep everything
on my private server.
Working on a secret
project, are we, sir?
I don't want this winding
up in the wrong hands.
Maybe in mine it could
actually do some good.
Next.
Up.
Not the boot, Dummy, right here.
You got me?
Stay put. Nice.
And you, you're no better
at it at all. Lift... I got it.
Okay, I'm sorry,
am I in your way?
Up.
That's great, don't even move.
You... are a tragedy.
Okay, lets do this right.
Start mark, half meter
back of the center.
Dummy, look for light.
Stand back for fire safety.
You, roll it.
Activate hand controls.
We are gonna start up
nice and easy,
raising 10% thrust capacity
to achieve lift.
And 3, 2, 1.
Up two? Alright, step back.
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?
Yeah, everything's... what?
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great, I'll be right up.
I thought you said you were
done making weapons?
It isn't. This is
a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.
I didn't expect that.
How'd it go?
Oh, went that bad huh?
Just because I brought
pizza back from New York
doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.
It would've gone better
if you were there.
You told me to lay low and
that's what I've been doing.
I lay low and you
take care of all the...
Hey, c'mon.
In public, the press...
This was a Board of
Directors meeting.
This was a Board of
Directors meeting?
The Board is claiming
a Post Traumatic Stress.
They are filing an injunction.
- A what?
They wanna lock you out.
Why, cause the stocks dip 40 points?
We knew this was gonna happen.
- 56 and a half.
- It doesn't matter.
We own a controlling
interest in the company.
Tony, the Board has rights too.
They are making the case that
you and your new direction
isn't in a company's
best interest.
I'm being responsible.
That's a new direction.
For me... for the company.
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...
- Oh, this is great!
- Oh c'mon, wait! Tony, Tony!
- I'll be in the shop.
- Hey, hey, Tony, listen.
I'm trying to turn
this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.
Something to pitch them.
Let me have the engineers
analyze that, you know,
draw some specs.
- No.
No. Absolutely not.
This one stays with me.
That's it Obie.
Forget it.
Alright, well this
stays with me then.
Go on, here, you can have
a piece. Take two. - Thank you.
Do you mind if I come down there
to see what you're doing?
Good night, Obie.
Day 11, Test 37,
Configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.
Alright, nice and easy.
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.
And 3, 2, 1.
Please don't follow me around
with it either cause I feel
like I'm going to catch on fire
spontaneously. Just stand down.
If something happens,
then come in.
Again, lets bring it up to 2.5%.
Okay, this is where
I don't want to be.
Not the car,
not the car.
It could be worse.
We are fine.
Okay, we are getting there.
Yeah. I can fly.
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.
Engage head up display.
Check.
Import all preferences
from home interface.
Will do, sir.
Alright, what do you say?
I have indeed been uploaded,
sir. We're online and ready.
Start the virtual walkaround.
Importing preferences and
calibrating virtual environment.
- Do a check on control surfaces.
- As you wish.
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.
Ah, yes... tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.
Start listening
the ground control.
Sir, there are still terabytes
of calculations needed
before an actual flight.
- Jarvis...
Sometimes you gotta run
before you can walk.
Ready? And 3, 2, 1.
It feels like a dream.
Alright, lets see what
this thing can do.
What's the SR-71's record?
The altitude record for fixed-wing
flight is 85.000 feet, sir.
Records are made
to be broken. C'mon!
Sir, there is a potentially fatal
build-up of ice occuring.
Keep going!
Higher!
We're iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps.
Jarvis?
C'mon, we gotta break the ice!
Cut power.
Note: main transducer feels
sluggish at plus 40 altitude.
The whole pressurization
is problematic.
I'm thinking 'icy' is
a probable factor.
A very astute observation, sir.
Perhaps if you intend to visit
other planets, we should
improve the exo systems.
Connect to the Cisco, have it
reconfigure the shell metals.
Use the gold-titanium alloy from
the Seraphim tactical satellite.
That should ensure
the fuselage integrity
while maintaining power
-to-weight ratio. Got it?
Yes. Shall I render using
proposed specifications?
Thrill me.
Tonight's red hot,
red carpeted,
right here at the
Disney Concert Hall,
where Tony Stark's
third annual benefit for
the Firefighters Family Fund
has become the place to be...
Jarvis, did we get
an invite from them?
I have no record of
the invitation, sir.
...haven't been seen in public
since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.
Some claim he's suffering
from PTS and has been
bed ridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,
no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.
The render is complete.
Little ostentatious,
don't you think?
What was I thinking?
You're usually so dicsrete.
Tell you what... throw a little
hot rot red in there.
Yes, that shall help you
keep a low profile.
The render is complete.
Yeah, I like it.
Fabricate it and paint it.
Commensing an
automated assembly.
Estimated completion
time is five hours.
Don't wait up for me, honey.
The weapons manufacturing is...
only a one small part of what
Stark Industries is all about...
- Hey Tony, remember me?
- I sure don't.
You look great, Hef.
What's the world coming to when
a guy's gotta crash his own party?
Look at you!
- Hey, what a surprise!
- I'll see you inside.
Listen, take it slow, alright?
I got the Board where
I really want them.
You got it. Just cabin fever,
I'll just be a minute.
Give me a Scotch,
I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.
- Oh yeah, the guy from the...
Strategic Homeland
Intervention
Enforcement and
Logistics Division.
God, you got... you need
a new name for that.
Yeah, I hear that a lot.
Listen, I know this must be
a trying time for you,
but we need to debrief you.
There's still a lot of
unanswered questions,
and time can be a factor
with these things.
Lets just put something
on the books.
How about the 24th, at 7 p.m.
at Stark Industries?
Tell you what... you got it.
You're absolutely right.
Well... I'm gonna go to my
assistant and we'll make it date.
You look fantastic,
I didn't recognise you.
- What are you doing here?
- Avoiding government agents.
- Are you here by yourself?
- Where'd you get that dress?
It was a birthday present
from you, actually.
- I have great taste.
- Yes.
- You, uh, wanna dance?
- Oh, no, thank you. No.
Am I making you uncomfortable?
No, no.
I always forget to
wear a deodorant,
and dance with my boss
in front of everyone
that I work with,
in a dress with no back.
- You look great, you
smell great. - Oh, God.
But I could fire you,
if that'd take the edge off.
I actually don't think that you
could tie your shoes without me.
- I'd make it a week.
Really? What's your
social security number?
- Five.
- Five?
You're missing just a
couple of digits there.
The other eight? That's why
I got you, for the other eight.
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.
- That was totally wierd.
- Totally harmless.
It was totally not harmless,
by the way.
- Nobody was watching us.
- Everybody who I work with...
I think you lost objectivity.
I think they... we just danced.
No, it was not
just the dance!
You don't understand
because you're you.
And everybody knows exactly who
you are, and how you are with girls.
And all that,
which is completely fine...
But you know, then me, you're
my boss and I'm dancing...
Because it makes me look like...
the one who's trying to...
I just think you're
overstating, that's all.
And we're here, and then I'm...
wearing this ridiculous dress...
And then we were
dancing like that and...
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it.
I would like a
vodka martini, please.
Very dry with olives,
lot of olives,
like at least three olives.
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.
Make one of them dirty.
- Well... Tony Stark!
- Oh, hey!
Fancy seeing you here.
- Carrie. - Christine.
- That's right.
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.
Can I at least get
a reaction from you?
Panic. I would say
panic is my reaction.
I was reffering to your
company's involvement
in this latest attrocity.
- They just put my name
on the invitation,
I don't know what to tell you.
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.
I was out of town for a couple
of months, in case you didn't hear.
Is this what you call
accountability?
It's a town called Gulmira.
Heard of it?
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.
Well, I'm not my company.
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?
- What's going on? - Tony, you
can't afford to be this naive.
I was naive before,
when they said:
Here's the line, we don't cross it,
this is how we do business.
If we're double-dealing
under the table... are we?
Let's take a picture.
Come on.
Picture time!
Tony... who do you
think locked you out?
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.
It's the only way
I can protect you.
The fifteen miles hike
to the outskirts of Gulmira
can only be described
as a 'descent into Hell'.
Into a modern day
heart of darkness.
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages
have been driven
from their homes
displaced from their
lands by warlords,
emboldened by
a newfound power.
Villagers have been
forced to take shelter
in whatever ways
that they can find.
In the ruins of other villages
or here, in the remnants of
the old Soviet smelting plant.
Recent violence has been
attributed to a group
of foreign fighters, reffered to
by locals as the Ten Rings.
As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.
A mission that can prove fatal to
anyone who stands in their way.
With no political will or
international pressure,
there's very little hope
for these refugees.
Around me, a woman begging
for news on her husband
who was kidnapped
by insurgents.
Either forced to
join their militia...
...to anyone who will stop
a child's simple question:
"Where are my
mother and father?"
There's very little hope
for these refugees,
refugees who can only wonder
who, if anyone, will help.
Faster!
Women on the trucks!
The weapons here!
Abandon houses!
Hurry up!
Hold this rebel!
Put him with the others.
Father!
What the hell is this?
Kill this bastard!
You are incopetent!
Turn your head!
Father!
He is all yours.
AIR BASE EDWARDS,
CALIFORNIA
- What the hell was that?
- Are we clear to go in there?
No, sir. They were
using human shields.
We never got the green light.
Department of State,
they're gonna be all over this.
We got a bogey.
Is CIA on the line?
I got them on line,
they wanna know if it's us.
No, that definitely
is not us, sir.
- It wasn't navy.
- Wasn't marines.
I need answers! Can I please
get eyes on target?
Get me colonel Rhodes
from the Weapons developement
down here now!
We ran an ID check
and crossed reference
with all known databases.
We have nothing.
Any high-altitude surveillance
in the region?
We've got an AWAC and
a Global Hawk in the area.
So this things just
appeared out of nowhere?
How come it didn't
show up on the Radar?
It's got a minimum Radar
cross-section, sir.
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir. It's tiny.
We think it's an
unmanned aerial vehicle.
Colonel, what are we
dealing with here?
I'm gonna make a call.
- Hello?
- Tony?
- Who is this?
- It's Rhodes.
Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.
- Speak up, please.
- What the hell is that noise?
- I'm driving with the top down.
Yeah, well I need
your help right now.
It's funny how
that works, huh?
Yeah, speaking of funny,
we got a weapons depot
that was just blown up
a few cliques from where
you've been held captive.
- Well, that's a hot spot.
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did you job for you.
Why do you sound
out of breath, Tony?
- I was just jogging at the canyon.
- I thought you were driving.
Right, I was driving to the
canyon where I'm gonna jog.
Are you sure you don't have
any tech in that area...
...I should know about?
- Nope.
Bogey spotted!
Okay, good, cause I'm
staring at one right now
and it's about to be
blown to kingdom come
War room, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sight.
- Whiplash One, what is it?
- I've got no idea.
- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.
Then you are clear to engage.
Bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!
Incoming missile.
- Flairs!
Wait a second!
Bogey deployed flairs.
Deploy flaps!
Holly... this thing just
drove off the Radar, sir!
Satellite image has been lost.
- No way that's the U.A.V.
- What is it?
I can't see anything.
Whatever it was,
it just bought the farm.
I think bogey has
been handled, sir.
- Hello? - Hi, Rhodey, it's me.
- It's who?
I'm sorry, it IS me. You asked
what that was, and it was me.
No, see.. this isn't a game.
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.
You understand that?
It's not a piece of equipment.
I am in it. It's a suit. It's me!
Rhodey, you got anything for me?
Mark your position and
return to base. - Roger that.
On your belly!
It looks like a... man!
Shake him off!
Move, move!
I'm hit!
I'm hit!
Eject! Eject!
Whiplash One down.
- Whiplash 2, do you see a chute?
- Negative! No chute! No chute!
My chute's jammed!
Sir, I've got a visual
on a bogey.
Whiplash 2, reengage. If you
get a clear shot, you take it!
Major, we don't even know what we're
shooting at. Call off the Raptors.
That thing just took out an F-22
inside the legal no-fly zone.
Whiplash 2, if you have
a clear shot, take it.
They've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.
Keep going!
Got a chute!
Got a chute!
- Tony, are you still there?
- Hey, thanks.
Oh my God, you crazy
son of a bitch!
You owe me a plane,
you know that, right?
Yeah, well, technically
he hit me, so...
Now are you gonna come by and
see what I'm working on? - No, no.
The less I know the better.
Now what am I supposed
to tell to the press?
Training excercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?
It's not that simple.
An unfortunate
training excercise
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.
I'm pleased to report that
the pilot was not injured.
As for the unexpected turn of
events on the ground in Gulmira,
it is still unclear who
or what intervened,
but I can assure you that the U.S.
government was not involved.
Oh, it isn't that bad, sir.
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.
Be gentle,
this is my first time.
I designed this to come off.
Please try not to move.
What's going on here?
Let's face it, this is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.
Are those bullet holes?
Welcome.
Compliments of Tony Stark.
If you killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.
You paid us trinkets
to kill a prince.
Show me the weapon.
Come. Leave your
guards outside.
His escape bore
unexpected fruit.
So this is how he did it.
This is only a first crude effort.
Stark has perfected his design.
He has made a
masterpiece of death.
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.
And you dream of Stark's throne.
We have a common enemy.
We are still in business.
I will give you these designs...
...as a gift.
And in return...
...I hope you repay me
with a gift of iron soldiers.
This is the only gift
you will recieve.
Technology.
That's always been your Achilles
heel in this part of the world.
Don't worry. It will only
last for 15 minutes.
That's the least
of your problems.
Bring the armour
and the rest of it.
Alright, lets finish up here.
Set up Sector 16
underneath the Arc reactor.
And I want this dead and masked.
Recruit our top engineers.
I want a prototype right away.
Are you busy?
I need you to go to my office
and hack into the mainframe.
You're gonna retrieve all
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip,
this will get you in.
It's probably under
Executive Files, if not...
they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need to look
for the lowest
numeric heading.
And what do you plan to do
with this information
if I bring it back here?
- Same drill.
They've been dealing under
the table, I'm gonna stop them.
I'm gonna find my weapons
and destroy them.
Tony...
you know that I would
help you with anything,
but I can not help you if you're
gonna start all of this again.
There is nothing except this.
There's no art openings,
there's no benefit,
there's nothing to sign.
There's the next mission,
and nothing else.
Is that so?
Well, then I quit.
You stood by my side
all these years
while I reaped the
benefits of destruction.
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people
that I've put in harm's way,
your going to walk out?
You're gonna kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not gonna be a part of it.
I shouldn't be alive...
unless it was for a reason.
I'm not crazy, Pepper.
I just finally know
what I have to do.
And I know in my heart
that it's right.
You're all I have
too, you know.
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?
You did not tell us that
the target you paid us to kill
was the great Tony Stark.
As you can see,
Obadiah Stane, your deception
and lies will cost you dearly.
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.
So... what are we
gonna do about this?
I know what you're
going through, Pepper.
Ah, Tony. He always gets
the good stuff, doesn't he?
I was so happy...
when he came home. It was like
we got him back from the dead.
And now I realise...
...well, Tony never really
did come home, did he?
He left a part of himself
in that cave.
Breaks my heart.
Well...
He is a complicated person.
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be alright.
You are a very rare woman.
Tony doesn't know
how lucky he is.
Thank you. Thanks.
I gotta get back there.
Is that today's paper?
Yes.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.
- Of course.
Take care.
Ms. Potts?
We had an appointment.
Did you forget about
our appointment?
Nope. Right now,
come with me.
I'll give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.
We've been working our best.
Absolutely, we're... I'm gonna
have to call you back.
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored
what you've asked us
and it seems as though there's
a little hiccup, actually...
- A hiccup?
- Yes, to power the suit...
sir, the technology actually
doesn't exist. So it's...
Wait, wait, the technology?
William, here is
the technology.
I've asked you to simply
make it smaller.
Okay, sir, that's what
we're trying to do,
but honestly,
it's impossible.
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!
With a box of scraps!
I'm sorry.
I'm not Tony Stark.
Tony?
Tony, are you there?
Breathe.
Easy, easy...
You remember this one, right?
It's a shame the government
didn't approve.
There are so many applications
regarding short-term paralysis.
Ah, Tony.
When I ordered
the hit on you,
I was worried that I was...
...killing the golden goose.
But, you see...
it was just fate
that you survived it,
leaving one last
golden egg to give.
You really think that just
because you have an idea,
it belongs to you?
Your father, he helped to
give us the atomic bomb.
Now what kind of world
would it be today
if he was as selfish as you?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Ah, Tony...
This is your Ninth Symphony.
What a masterpiece!
Look at that.
This is your legacy.
The generation of weapons...
...with this at its heart.
The weapons that will help
stir the world back on course.
With the balance of power
in our hands.
In the right hands.
I wish you could see
my prototype.
It's not as... not as
conservative as yours.
Too bad you had to
involve Pepper in this.
I would've prefered
that she lived.
What do you mean he paid
to have Tony killed?
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...
okay, where is Tony now?
I don't know, he's not
answering his phone.
Please go there and make
sure everything's okay.
Thank you, Rhodey.
I know a shortcut.
Good boy.
Tony?
Tony?
Tony?
Tony!
- Are you okay?
- Where is Pepper?
She's fine. She's with five agents
that are about to arrest Obadiah.
That's not gonna be enough.
Section 16.
Section 16...
There it is.
My key's not working,
it's not opening the door.
Wow, what is that? It's like
a little device, like a thing
that's gonna pick the lock?
-You may wanna take few steps back.
That's the coolest thing I've
ever seen. - Not bad, huh?
Let's do it.
You need me to do
anything else?
Keep the skies clear.
Damn!
Next time, baby.
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.
I thought it'll be bigger.
Take him out!
How do you think the Mark One
chest piece is gonna hold up?
That chest piece was never
designed for sustained flight.
Keep me posted.
- Pepper.
- Tony?
- Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- Obadiah, he's gone insane.
- I know. Listen!
- You better get outta there!
- He built the suit.
Get outta there, right now!
Where do you think
you're going?
Your services are
no longer required.
Stane!
- I love this suit!
- Put them down.
Collateral damage, Tony.
Defer the power
to chest piece.
Power reduced to 19%.
Lady!
For thirty years,
I've been holding you up.
I built this company
from nothing!
And nothing is gonna
stand in my way.
And least of all, you.
Impressive!
You upgraded your armour.
I've made some
upgrades of my own.
Sir, it appears that
his suit can fly.
Duly noted. Take me
to the maximum altitude.
With only 15% power, the odds
of reaching that altitude...
I know the math! Do it!
Sir, you're not gonna believe this.
That thing is back.
Get me major Allen.
Scramble the jets!
Not necessary, people,
just the training exercise.
- 13% power, sir.
- Climb!
-11%.
- Keep going!
- 7% power. - Just leave it on
the screen, stop telling me.
You had a great idea, Tony,
but my suit is more
advanced in every way!
How'd you solve
the icing problem?
Icing problem?
Might want to look into it.
We are now running on
emergency backup power.
- Potts!
- Tony!
Oh my God, are you okay?
I'm almost dead of power,
I gotta get out of this thing.
I'll be right there.
- Nice try.
Weapons status?
Repulsors are off line.
Flairs!
Very clever, Tony.
- Potts.
- Tony!
This isn't working, we're gonna
have to overload the reactor
and blast the roof.
- How are you gonna do that?
You're gonna do it.
Go to the central console,
open up bolt of circuits.
When I clear the roof
I'll let you know
and you're gonna hit
the master bypass button.
That's gonna fry
everything up here.
Okay, I am going in now.
Make sure you wait till I clear
the roof, I'll buy you some time.
This looks important.
I never had a taste
for this sort of thing,
but I must admit, I'm
deeply enjoying the suit.
You finally outdid
yourself, Tony.
It would've made
your father proud.
It's ready, Tony!
Get off the roof!
Tony!
How ironic, Tony!
Trying to free
the world of weapons,
you gave it
the best one ever!
- Pepper!
- And now...
I'm gonna kill you with it!
You ripped up my
targeting system.
- Hit the button!
- You told me not to!
Hold still, you little prick.
- Just do it!
- You'll die!
Push it!
Tony!
We've all received
the official statement
of what occured at
Stark Industries last night.
There have been unconfirmed
reports that a robotic prototype
malfunctioned and caused
damage to the Arc reactor.
"Iron Man", that's kinda catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.
It's not technically accurate,
since it's a gold-titanium alloy,
but it's kinda attractive
name anyway.
Here is your alibi.
- Okay.
- You were on your yacht.
We told Pepper to put
you in Avalon all night
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.
I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me,
alone on the island.
That's what happened.
Just read it word for word.
There's nothing
about Stane here.
That's been handled.
He's on vacation.
Small aircraft have such
a poor safety record.
What about this whole story
that it's a body guard?
He's my body... ?
That's kinda flimsy.
This isn't my first rodeo,
Mr. Stark.
Just stick to the official statement
and soon this will all be behind you.
You've got 90 seconds.
Oh, agent Coulson.
I just wanted to say thank you
very much for all of your help.
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.
Right.
- Lets get the show on the road.
- You know, it's actually...
...not that bad... even I
don't think I'm Iron Man.
- You're not Iron Man.
- Yeah I am.
- You're not.
- Suite yourself.
If I were Iron Man,
I'd have this girlfriend
who knew my true identity.
She'd be a wreck.
She'd always be worrying
that I was gonna die,
and yet proud of a man
I become. She'd be...
wildly conflicted, which
would only make her more...
crazy about me. Tell me you
never think about that night?
- What night?
- You know.
Are you talking about...
the night that we danced,
and went up to the roof...
and then...
you went downstairs
to get me a drink, and you...
left me there by myself?
Is that the night
you're talking about?
I thought so.
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that'd be all, Ms. Potts.
And now Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.
He will not be taking
any questions, thank you.
It's been a while since
I was in front of you,
I figure I'll stick
to the cards this time.
There's been speculation that
I was involved in the events
that occured on a freeway
and the rooftop...
I'm sorry Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that
that was a bodyguard in a suit,
that conveniently appeared,
despite the fact that...
- I know that it's confusing...
It is one thing to question
the official story,
and another entirely
to make wild accusations
or insinuate that
I'm a superhero.
- I never said you're
a superhero. - You didn't?
Well, good, because that
would be outlandish and...
...fantastic.
I'm just not the hero type,
clearly. With this...
long list of character defects
and all the mistakes I've made,
largely in public.
- Just stick to the cards.
- Yeah, okay.
The truth is...
I am Iron Man.
Long ago that I'm
before Qty. but no evidence exists.
It has been said about my
participation on the events that occurred
- On the street ...
- Sorry, sir, but do not believe that the use
a bodyguard
be more appropriate.
Yes.
And if more
weapons in it.
One thing's have the official version and others
thing to do is point the finger
and say that I am a
kind of superhero.
You have to accept that I have
the kind of hero.
This long list of character defects
and the mistakes I made in public.
The point is ...
I am a man of iron.
- Am I wrong.
- Only some rest you will recover.
I can not go.
I'm wrong.
ARCA REACTOR
... We are in 4500 meters
we are about the area.
Nice to see them.
The late.
And I did.
I already did.
I'm not saying that the world has its
the longest period of uninterrupted peace
thanks to me.
I'm not saying I
spent in my captivity.
Something I had never
personified as good in history.
I'm not saying that our Uncle Sam is
not here anymore and rests in its mln.
Enjoying this because I
could find someone who is
Then, out and wins
my best day.
Thanks, do not talk about me.
I'm not talking about you
I'm not talking about us, talk
a legacy.
I speak of what we decided
leave for future generations.
That's why the entire year
and for the first time since 64.
The most brilliant men and women
nations and the corporate world
will pool resources and give us your
collective vision of how to build a better future.
Not for us, so as to
finish and I can tell you otherwise.
Welcomed the project.
And now I present to a client that is
special and will talk about it.
I ask for applause
for my father Howard.
Anything is possible with technology.
Better life, good health.
And for the first time in history
of humanity, the ability
world peace.
On behalf of everyone here I STARK INDUSTRY
personally presented the city's future.
The technology lets
potential for many humans.
TOXICITY 200%
Soon the technology will affect
how they live their daily lives.
Nothing more tedious, leave this
time for other activities.
And enjoy the sweet life.
That is Expo Stark welcome.
It is fully active
exhibition is the inauguration
and everyone tries to leave the scene.
If they can not come, do not worry
lasts all year.
You may be here in the halls stock with
inventions that come from all over the world.
Ready here we go.
Hello friends, thank you
for coming. That's cute.
Hello
What is this?
On one side you.
- Wow.
- Your autograph.
Good.
- EL is Aby.
- The teacher today.
Call me to talk, call me.
I will.
Hey friend, this is the best.
Many more opportunities.
- Many hands really.
- It was not so bad.
- If you came out perfect.
- What Car? It is the latest model.
- And it comes with the car?
- Well, I hope so.
- Hello
- Hello
- And you are?
- I'm Poli.
- This is weird.
- It's a great pleasure.
I drive, do you mind?
Where are you?
- From Redcord.
- What are you doing here?
- Buscandote.
- So here I am.
- And then?
- Bring subpoenas.
- Do not receive service.
- Yes, I'm not.
- I maintain it.
- Having been summoned to appear in
Services Committee
tomorrow at 9:00.
- So you're a cop?
- I am the federal police.
- And bring your plate?
- You like?
Yes.
So how is Washington?
It is 400 km.
Mr. Stark can continue
question, Mr. Stark, please.
- Tell me baby.
- Can I ask your attention?
With pleasure.
- True or not have a weapon specialist.
- Not so.
- It is not.
- Not so.
Depends on how you define
weapon.
- The weapon of Iron Man
- My invention is not well described.
- How would you describe yourself?
- I would describe how to define what is truly Mr.
- What is this?
- An advanced prostheses.
- This is the best description I can do.
- It is a weapon, Mr. Stark hate to tell you ...
- If the Sub-Prior was serious, that ...
- No, my priority is that the gun's iron man
delivery to the people of Brazil
E.U.A..
So, forget it.
I am Iron Man suit and I are one, real
delivering Iron Man suit that I surrender.
Which is similar to slavery, depending
about the same state prostitution.
- He will not have Mr.
- Look, I'm not an expert.
In prostitution, as is thought
a Senator, please.
I am not a weapons expert.
We brought a weapons expert.
I would call our Dustin Hammer
today's top weapons contractor.
Let it be recorded that I see
Mr. Hammer entered the chamber.
And I wonder when they will arrive
weapons expert who speaks.
Actually yes, I'm not an expert,
is you.
You are the example.
Senator, if I can.
Can not be an expert, you know
Who was the expert?
Who do you think?
Haward Stark.
A father to us. E
for the entire military industry Tony.
But it must be clear that not dajar
flowers spread, it was a lion.
All we know why we are here in these six
months Tony Stark has created a weapon
with many possibilities and
He insists it is a shield.
He Confinenme
say, as I know cringe.
As I like to feel
insurance, actually, yes.
I do not
lock the house.
But never where we live
a world full of threats.
When Mr. Stark does not
have the ability to predict.
Thank you, God bless
Iron Man and the country.
Very well said Mr. Hammer.
The committee now invites the lieutenant
Colonel James Rhodes for the camera.
Rhodey "?
Friend, do not wait
see it here.
- Tony, and accept what happens with a vine?.
- Ok, I do not believe it.
I have here a complete report of the gun
Iron Man, compiled by Colonel Rhodes.
Colonel registration can
read section 4 on page 57.
Specific request you to read
parts of my report of the senator?
If Mr.
I was told it was going to testify
more comprehensive and detailed.
- There were changes, I understand Mr.
- Tell me to read numbers out of context does not reflect ...
The colonel read it I understand.
Thank you.

I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
- HAPPY: You good?
- Yeah.
- HAPPY: I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.
(CHEERING CONTINUES)
TONY'. So, why am I telling you this?
Because I had just created demons
and I didn't even know it.
- Yeah, those were good times.
-(DOOR CLOSES)
Then I moved on.
After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said goodbye to the party scene.
I forgot that night in Switzerland.
These days, I'm a changed man.
JARVIS: Forty-six.
- TONY: I'm different now.
-(TONY GROANS)
I'm... Well...
JARVIS: Forty-seven.
TONY: You know who I am.
Ow!
JARVIS: Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate...
No. Forty-eight.
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)
Micro-repeater

As you wish, sir.
I've also prepared a safety briefing
for you to entirely ignore.
Which I will.
All right, let's do this.
(SNIFFS)
DUM-E.
Hi, DUM-E.
How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.
Hey. Hey!
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.
Blood on my mat. Handle it.
Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours?
(WHOOSHING)
Focus up, ladies.
Good evening,
and welcome to the birthing suite.
I am pleased to announce
the imminent arrival
of your bouncing,
bad-ass baby brother.
Start tight and then go wide.
Stamp date and time.

(FUNKY CHRISTMAS

(SINGING) Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
(GRUNTS)
Bells on bob tails ring
Crap.
Oh, what fun it is to sing
A sleighing song tonight
(WHIRRING)
Jingle bells, jingle bells
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
(WHIRRING)

(STRAINED) Cool it, will you, Jarvis?
(GRUNTS)
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
-(RECORD SCRATCHES)
-(MUSIC STOPS)
Come on. I ain't scared of you.
I'm the best.
(GRUNTS)
(GROANING)
As always, sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.
TONY: I guess 72 hours is a long time
between siestas.
I didn't think it could get any worse.
(GROANING SOFTLY)
Then I had to go and turn on the TV.
That's when he happened.
THE MANDARIN: Some people
call me a terrorist.
(MAN YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
(GUNS FIRING)
I consider myself a teacher.
(CHEERING)
America.
Ready for another lesson?
In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado,
the US military waited
until the friendly Cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting.
Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind
and claim their land.
39 hours ago,
the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait
was attacked.
I... I... I did that.
A quaint military church
filled with wives and children,
of course.
The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.
The braves were away.
President Ellis.
You continue to resist my attempts
to educate you, sir.
And now you've missed me again.
(MEN YELLING)
(GUNS FIRING)
You know who I am.
You don't know where I am.
And you'll never see me coming.
PAT KIERNAN: Now that
we seem to be back,
let's recap some
of the frightening developments...
American airwaves were hijacked...
The nation remains on high alert.
All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.
ELLIS: Central to my administration's
response to this terrorist event
is a newly minted resource.
I know him
as Colonel James Rhodes.
The American people
will soon know him
as the Iron Patriot.
And how is President Ellis responding?
By taking the guy
they call War Machine
and giving him a paint job.
The same suit,
but painted red, white and blue.
Look at that. And they also
renamed him, "Iron Patriot."
You know,
just in case the paint was too subtle.
It tested well with focus groups,
all right?
(GRUFFLY)
"I am Iron Patriot!" it sucks.
Listen. "War Machine"
was a little too aggressive.
All right?
This sends a better message.
(SIGHS)
So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?
It's classified information, Tony.
Okay, there have been nine bombings.
- Nine.
- The public only knows about three.
But here's the thing,
nobody can ID a device.
There's no bomb casings.
You know I can help.
Just ask.
I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.
(STAMMERING)
I got bomb disposal.
It catches explosions in mid-air.
When's the last time
you got a good night's sleep?
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.
People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.
You're going to come at me like that?
No, look, I'm not trying to be a dick...
...tator.
Do you mind signing my drawing?
- If Richard doesn't mind.
-(CHUCKLES)
Are you all right with this, Dick?
RHODEY:
Yeah. Fine with me.
- TONY: What's your name?
-Erin.
I loved you in A Christmas Story,
by the way.
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.
After New York, aliens... Come on.
They need to look strong.
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority,
but it's not...
-it's not superhero business.
- No, it's not, quite frankly.
- I get it.
-It's American business.
That's why I said I got it.
-(EXHALES SHARPLY)
- Are you okay?
I broke the crayon.
ERIN:
Are you okay, Mr Stark?
-(MUFFLED) Take it easy. Tony.
-(INHALES SHARPLY)
(WHISPERING) How did you
get out of the Wormhole?
-(GASPS)
- Wait a minute. Tony!
TONY: What did you say?
RHODEY: Tony.
(GRUNTS) Sorry.
(BREATHLESSLY) I'm just
checking on the suit.
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
Okay.
(PANTING)
(GASPING)
Check the heart.
(STAMMERING)
Is it the brain?
JARVIS: No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.
Okay, so I was poisoned?
My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.
- Me?
-(METALLIC CLINKING)
Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.
TONY: Sorry, I gotta split.
(GRUNTS)
(CROWD GASPS IN AWE)
HAPPY: Badge.
- Badge.
-(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Come on, badge.
Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.
Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.
- This is an asset that we can put to use.
- Uh-huh.
So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots.
- Thank you.
- What I'm saying is that
the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability.
We should start
phasing it out immediately.
- What?
- Excuse me, Bambi,
-you should be wearing...
- Did you just say that?
- Security? Yes?
- Happy? Okay.
I am thrilled that you are now
the Head of Security. Okay?
- It is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.
- However...
- I do appreciate it.
-...since you've taken the post...
- You don't have to thank me.
...we've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300%.
Thank you.
It's not a compliment.
It's not...
It is a compliment.
Clearly, somebody's
trying to hide something.
- I. .. Yes.
- SECRETARY: Excuse me.
Ms Potts, your 4:00 is here.
- Thank you.
- Did you clear this 4:00 with me?
Happy, we'll talk about this later,
but right now, I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.
How so?
I used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time,
so it's a little awkward.
I don't like the sound of that.
Pepper
Killian?
You look great.
You look really great.
PEPPER: (STAMMERING)
God, you look great.
L... l... I...
What on earth have you been doing?
Nothing fancy.
Just five years in the hands
of physical therapists.
And please, call me Aldrich.
Uh, you were supposed to be
issued a security badge.
- Happy, it's okay. We're good.
- Yes.
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes. Stand down.
- I'm going to linger right here. Okay.
- Thank you.
It's very nice to see you, Killian.
(PHONES RINGING)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Hey, guy.
Merry Christmas.
KILLIAN: After years dodging
the President's ban
On "immoral" biotech research,
my think tank
now has a little something
in the pipeline.
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.
I'm gonna turn your lights down.
Regard the human brain.
(HUMMING)
Uh... Wait, hold on, hold on.
That's...
That's the universe. My bad.
But if I do that...
That's the brain.
Strangely mimetic, though,
wouldn't you say?
Wow, that's amazing.
Thanks, it's mine.
What?
This. You're inside my head.
It's a...
It's a live feed.
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.
Come on.
Now, pinch my arm.
- I can take it. Pinch me.
-(CHUCKLES)
(GASPS) What is that?
It's the primary somatosensory cortex.
It's the brain's pain centre.
But this is what I wanted to show you.
(BEEPS)
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses
our bioelectrical potential
and it goes here.
This is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us
is that our mind,
our entire DNA, in fact,
is destined to be upgraded.
Wow.
(QUIET RINGING)
(WHISPERS)
Oh, wait...
-(RINGING CONTINUES)
- Uh...
-(CHIMES)
- Hello?
- TONY: Is this Forehead of Security?
- What?
You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?
I'm working.
I've got something going on, here.
What, harassing interns?
Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened
when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?
- They would laugh in my face.
(TONY CHUCKLES)
I had to leave
while I still had a shred of dignity.
Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.
What's going on? Fill me in.
- For real?
- Yeah.
All right.
So, she's meeting up with this scientist.
- Rich guy. Handsome.
- Rig ht.
I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.
- Oh, yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah.
Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.
Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...
Where were we in '99?
- The science conference?
-Um...
- Switzerland.
- Right, right, exactly.
Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.
Of course you don't remember.
He's not a blond with a big rack.
At first, it was fine.
They were talking business.
But now it's, like, getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.
- His what?
- Big brain.
And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.
Hold on. See?
Look at what? You, watching them?
Flip the screen,
and then we can get started.
I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.
Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.
I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!
Don't talk to me like that any more.
You're not my boss.
All right?
I don't work for you.
And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.
He's shifty.
- Relax.
- Seriously?
I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.
Tell them to go out
for a drink or something.
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.
This woman's the best thing
that ever happened to you
and you're just ignoring her.
- A giant brain?
- Yeah.
There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna
run his plates and I'm gonna...
You know,
if it gets rough, so be it.
I miss you, Happy-
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.
Now you're off with the super-friends.
I don't know
what's going on with you any more.
- The world's getting weird.
- Hey!
(STAMMERING)
I hate to cut you off.
- Do you have your Taser on you?
- Why?
I think there's a gal in H.R.
who's trying to steal some printer ink.
You should probably go over there
and zap her.
Yeah, nice.
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism
and recode its DNA.
- That would be incredible.
- Hmm.
Unfortunately, to my ears,
it also sounds highly weaponisable.
As in, enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is...
Tony, TOW-
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM
13 years ago.
He turned me down.
But something tells me
now there's a new genius on the throne
who doesn't have to
answer to Tony any more
and who has slightly less of an ego.
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.
As much as I'd like to help you.
Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.
But then,
as my father used to say,
"Failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph."
- That's very deep.
- Hmm.
And I have no idea
what it means.
No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.
(INHALES SHARPLY) Happy.
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.
Yes, I just, um...
God, I forgot my other things, so...
I'm just gonna...
(CAMERA CLICKS)
(SIGHS)
I'm sorry I'm late. I was...
What the...
What is that?
You're wearing this in the house now?
What is that, like, Mark 15?
TONY: Uh, yeah.
Something like that.
You know, everybody needs a hobby.
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?
TONY:
Just breaking it in.
You know, it's always a little pinchy
in the gooey bag
-at first, so...
-(CHUCKLES)
Well, hey, did you see
your Christmas present?
Yes, I did. I...
I don't know how I could've
missed that Christmas present.
Is it gonna fit through the door?
TONY: Well, actually,
it's a good question.
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow.
They're gonna blow out that wall.
- Okay.
- So, uh...
Tense? Good day? Huh?
Ooh, shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.
I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?
Did I like it?
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.
I appreciate the thought very much.
So, why don't you lift up that face mask
and give me a kiss?
(IMITATING COMPUTER BEEPING)
Huh...
Yep. Damn it, no can do.
You want to just kiss it on the...
- The facial slit?
- Uh-huh.
Well, why don't I
run down to the garage
and see if I can't find a crowbar
to jimmy that thing open?
Crowbar, yeah.
Oh! Except there's been
(STAMMERING) a radiation leak.
- PEPPER: I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.
(STRAINED)
At least, let me get you
like, a hazmat suit
you can... (GRUNTS)
- A Geiger counter or something like that.
-(STRAINING)
Busted.
- This is a new level of lame.
- Sorry.
You ate without me already?
On date night?
- He was just...
- You mean you.
Well, yeah, I just mean
we were just hosting you...
(SCOFFS IN DISBELIEF)
-...while I finished up a little work.
- Uh-huh.
And yes, I had a quick bite.
I didn't know if you were coming home
or you were having drinks
with Aldrich Killian.
- What?
- What?
Aldrich Killian?
What, are you checking up on me?
Happy was concerned.
- No, you're spying on me.
- I wasn't.
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on.
Come on. Pep?
Hey, I admit it.
My fault. Sorry.
I'm a piping hot mess.
It's been going on for a while.
I haven't said anything.
Nothing's been the same
since New York.
Oh, really?
I didn't notice that at all.
You experience things
and then they're over,
and you still can't explain them.
Gods, aliens, other dimensions.
I'm just a man in a can.
The only reason I haven't cracked up
is probably because you moved in.
Which is great.
I love you. I'm lucky.
But honey, I can't sleep.
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know.
I tinker. I... (SIGHS)
Threat is imminent.
And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.
That's you.
And my suits, they're, uh...

They're part of me.

Maybe.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Okay.
And you're gonna join me.

We're hoping he'll give us
the reaction...
His reaction
to the latest attack.
-(REPORTERS CLAMOURING)
- Mr Stark, hi there.
Our sources are telling us that all signs
are pointing to another Mandarin attack.
Anything else you can tell us?

When is somebody gonna kill this guy?
I'm just saying.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
Is that what you want?
Here's a little holiday greeting
I've been wanting to send
to the Mandarin.
I just didn't know
how to phrase it until now.
My name is Tony Stark
and I'm not afraid of you.
I know you're a coward.
So I've decided
that you just died, pal.
I'm gonna come get the body.
There's no politics here.
It's just good old-fashioned revenge.
There's no Pentagon,
it's just you and me.
And on the off chance you're a man,
here's my home address.

There's lots of pageantry going on here.
Lots of theatre. Close.
The heat from the blast was in excess
of 3,000 degrees Celsius.
Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporised instantly.
No bomb parts found in a three-mile

No, sir.

When is a bomb not a bomb?
Any military victims?
Not according to public record, sir.

Nope.
That. Are you sure
that's not one of his?
It predates any known Mandarin attack.
The incident was the use of a bomb
to assist a suicide.

JARVIS: Gluten-free waffles, sir.
That's right.
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here.
It's urgent.
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship.
It's...
- With her.
- PEPPER: Tony?

- Yeah,

Please don't tell me
there's a 12-year-old kid
waiting in the car that I've never met.
He's 13.
No, I need your help.
But, what for? Why now?
Because I read the papers and frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.
I'll be fine.

I didn't know we were expecting guests.

That's how you did it, isn't it?

Okay. We've been through this.
- Nope.

I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea.
Please don't touch her bags.
This is how normal people behave.

I don't like it.

You don't like it.

I've got a lot of apologies to make

So... First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.
That was selfish and stupid,
and it won't happen again.
Also, it's Christmastime
and the rabbit's too big.
Done. Sorry.
And I'm sorry in advance
because I can't come home yet.
I need to find this guy.
You gotta stay safe, that's all I know.
I just stole a poncho

What happened to him?

I built him. I take care of him.
I'll fix him.
Like a mechanic?
Yeah.
Hmm.
If I was building
Iron Man and War Machine...
It's "Iron Patriot" HOW-
That's way cooler.
No, it's not.
Anyways, I would have added in,
um, the retro...
- Retro-reflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.
- Not a good idea.
- Oops.
What are you doing?
You're gonna break his finger?
He's in pain.
He's been injured. Leave him alone.
Sorry.
Are you?
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.
So, uh, who's home?
Well, my mom already left for the diner
and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.
I guess he won,
because that was six years ago.
Hmm.
Which happens. Dads leave.
No need to be a pussy about it.
Here's what I need.
A laptop, a digital watch,
a cell phone,
the pneumatic actuator from
your bazooka over there,
a map of town, a big spring
and a tuna fish sandwich.
What's in it for me?
- Salvation. What's his name?
- Who?
The kid that bullies you at school.
What's his name?
How'd you know that?
I got just the thing.
This is a pinata for a cricket.

I think that my boss
is working for the Mandarin.
So, if you still want to talk about it
I suggest that we get
ourselves someplace safe.
Your boss works for the Mandarin,
you think?
But Tony says you're a botanist. So...
That figures. What I actually am
is a biological DNA coder

Hey, kid, give me a little space.
What's the official story here?
What happened?
HARLEY: I guess this guy named
Chad Davis used to live roundabouts.
He won a bunch of medals in the army.
And one day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.
Then he blew himself up, right here.
- Six people died, right?
- Yeah.
- Including Chad Davis.
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.
Think about it.
Six dead. Only five shadows.
Yeah.
People said these shadows are
like the marks of souls going to heaven.
Except the bomb guy.
He went to hell,
on account of he didn't get a shadow.
That's why there's only five.
- Do you buy that?
-It's what everyone says.
You know what
this crater reminds me of?
No idea. I'm not...
I don't care.
That giant Wormhole in,

That's manipulative.
I don't want to talk about it.

no two ways about it,
in the street,
that a man shouldn't do.
- Next?
- Then,
they approached me
about the role,
and they knew about the drugs.
What did they say?
They'd get you off them?
They said they'd give me more.
They gave me things.
They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery.
They gave me things.
(SNORING)
Did you just nod off?
Hey.
No, and a lovely speedboat.
And the thing was, he needed someone
to take credit
for some accidental explosions.
(MIMICS EXPLOSION)
"He"?
- Killian?
- Killian.
- He created you?
- He created me.
Custom-made terror threat.
Yes. Yes.
His think tank thinked it up.
The pathology of a serial killer.
The manipulation
of Western iconography.
(WITHOUT ACCENT)
Ready for another lesson?
Blah, blah, blah.
No.
(WITH ACCENT) Of course,
it was my performance
that brought the Mandarin to life.
Your performance?
Where people died?
No, they didn't.
Look around you.
The costumes, green screen.
Honestly,
I wasn't on location for half this stuff.
And when I was,
it was movie magic, love.
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend
who's in a coma
and he might not wake up.
So you're gonna have
to answer for that.
You're still going down, pal.
You under...
(GRUNTS)
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?
No.
You should have pressed
the panic button.
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.
(TYPING)
TONY: Ah...
(SIGHS) okay-
It's just like old times, huh?
Oh, yeah. With zip ties.
It's a ball.
It wasn't my idea.
Okay. So you took Killian's card.
I took his money.
And here you are 13 years later,
in a dungeon.
- No.
- Yeah.
No, you're in a dungeon.
I'm free to go.
Yeah?
(SIGHS)
A lot has happened, Tony.
But I'm close.
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.
I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.
People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.
Maya, you're kidding yourself.
Then help me fix it.
Did I do that?
Yes.
I remember the night, not the morning.
Is this what
you've been chasing around?
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.
You used to have a moral psychology.
You used to have ideals.
You wanted to help people.
Now look at you.
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who
still has their soul.
Get me out of here.
Come on.
KILLIAN: You know what my old man
used to say to me?
One of his favourite of many sayings...
"The early bird gets the worm, but
the second mouse gets the cheese."
You're not still pissed off
about the Switzerland thing, are you?
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?
I'm here to thank you.
You gave me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.
Desperation.
If you think back to Switzerland,
you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?
Well, for the first 20 minutes,
I actually thought you'd show up.
And the next hour...
I considered taking that
one-step shortcut to the lobby.
If you know what I mean.
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.
But as I looked out over that city,
nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,
no one was even looking.
I had a thought that would
guide me for years to come.
Anonymity, Tony.
Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.
Right?
You simply rule
from behind the scenes.
Because the second
you give evil a face,
a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,
you hand the people a target.
You're something else.
You have met him, I assume?
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
I know he's a little
over the top sometimes.
It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...
He's a stage actor.
They say his Lear was
the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.
Anyway, the point is,
ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky,
subtlety has kind of had its day.
What's next for you in your world?
Well, I wanted to repay you
the selfsame gift
that you so graciously imparted to me.
(ORBS HUMMING)
Desperation.
Now, this is live.
I'm not sure if you can tell,
but at this moment
the body is trying to decide
whether to accept EXTREMIS
or just give up.
And if it gives up,
I have to say,
the detonation is quite spectacular.
But until that point,
it's really just a lot of pain.
-(CLICKS)
-(HUMMING CEASES)
We haven't even talked salary yet.
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?
MAYA: Let him go.
Hold on, hold on.
Maya...
I said, let him go.
What are you doing?
1200 CCs.
A dose half of this size, I'm dead.
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.
Maya, give me the injector.
If I die, Killian,
what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?
We're not doing this, okay?
What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
KILLIAN: The good news is,
a high-level position
has just been vacated.
(GROANS)
(SIGHS)
You are a maniac.
No, I'm a visionary.
But I do own a maniac.
And he takes the stage tonight.
Once we get the Patriot installed,
it will take me
nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.
Well, that's great,
but the last time I looked
there was somebody
inside of it.
(WHIRRING)
Afternoon, gentlemen.
(WHIRRING CEASES)
Hello, Colonel.
Step aside.
(LOW HUMMING)
(SIZZLING)
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Oh!
We'll get you out of there.
Don't worry.
You'll damage the armour.
Yes, I will.
But you can fix it, right?
I'm gonna take the Chinook
to base camp.
And I want Potts with me.
She's still in Phase Two.
You're not going deaf, are you?
(GROANING)
(WATCH BEEPING)
Careful, there.
It's a limited edition.
Hey, uh, Ponytail Express.
What's the mileage count
between Tennessee and Miami?
832 miles.
Very nice.
- I'm good like that.
-(BEEPING CONTINUES)
Can you, uh, stop that?
Break it, you bought it.
I think I bought it.
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.
That belongs to my friend's sister.
And that's why
I'm gonna kill you first.
- What are you gonna do to me?
- You'll see.
You're zip-tied to a bed.
This.
That.
Are you coming out?
(RHODEY PANTING)
Do not open. Do not open.
Don't open. Don't open.
-(BEEPING)
- All right. Let's go.
(GRUNTING)
You... You breathe fire? Okay.
(GROWLING)
(GRUNTING)
It's a glorious day, Savin.
This time tomorrow,
I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand,
and the world's
most feared terrorist in the other.
I'll own the war on terror.
Create supply and demand.
For you, for your brothers and sisters.
Trust me,
you're gonna be in a puddle of blood
on the ground in five, four, three...
Come on! Two...
How did we get this shift?
All right,
I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.
- Put down your weapons.
-(SIGHING)
Tie yourselves to those chairs.
I'll let you live.
In five, four, bang!
- Ooh!
- Wow. That was...
You should be gone by now.
You should've already been gone.
I am just beyond terrified.
Here it comes.
- Three, four...
- Shut up.
- Five, four, three, two, one!
-(GRUNTING)
- Told you.
-(GROANS)
(GROANING)
Where's the rest?
(RATTLING)
(REPULSOR POWERING UP)
(CLAMOURING)
(GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
(SCREAMING)
Honestly,
I hate working here. They are so weird.
(GRUNTING)
Ah! Better late than never.
Not this time.
Not the face.
Phew! It's good to be back.
Hello, by the way.
JARVIS: Oh, hello, sir.
(BEEPING)
GUARD'. All personnel, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.
Repeat, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.
- Ah! Let's go!
-(THRUSTERS MISFIRING)
Aw, crap.
(GROANING)
(GRUNTING)
Tony?
Rhodey, tell me
that was you in the suit.
- No. You got yours'?
-Uh... Mmm.
Kind of.
Main house, as fast as you can.
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.
(SNORING)
- You, you, you! Move! Get out!
-(GIRLS WHIMPERING)
The room is secure.
I have eyes on the Mandarin.
- What's this? I had winners.
-(GUNSHOTS)
What have you come as?
You make a move,
and I break your face.
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.
This is the Mandarin?
Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.
But, um, hey,
if you're here to arrest me,
there's some people I'd like to roll on.
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.
You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.
- Doing what?
-(SIZZLING)
on! I get it! Ow! That hurt.
I get it! I get it!
I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.
Spill.
RHODEY: Do you know
what they did to my suit?
What? No.
But I do know it's happening
off the coast.
Something to do with a big boat.
I can take you there.
(CHANTING)
Ole', ole', ole', ole'...
Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.
Oh, and this next bit may include
the vice president as well.
Is that...
Is that important?
- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.
TONY: So?
RHODEY: What are we gonna do?
I mean, we don't have any transport.
- Right.
-(BEER OPENS)
Hey, Ringo.
Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.
But we also have to figure out this
-vice president thing, right?
- Right.
I wonder who I'm calling right now.
Oh! That's the vice president.
Thanks.
Hello?
TONY". Sir, this is Tony Stark.
Welcome back to the land of the living.
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.
Mr Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,
surrounded by the Agency's finest.
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.
I think we're good, here.
RHODEY: Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.
They're gonna take out
the president somehow.
We have to immediately
alert that plane.
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.
- Thank you, Colonel.
Rhodes and Stark out.
Everything okay, sir?
Couldn't be better.
I love you, babe.
Colonel Rhodes.
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.
RHODEY:
We gotta make a decision.
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.
JARVIS: Sir,
I have an update from Malibu.
The cranes have finally arrived,
and the cellar doors
are being cleared as we speak.
TONY: And what about
the suit I'm wearing?
JARVIS: The armour is now at 92%.
That's going to have to do.
Oh! Here he comes.
Here he comes. Get a quick picture.
Sure.
Oh!
(SIZZLING)
(BEEPING)
Everything all right, Colonel?
(GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
(GROANING)
(SCREAMING)
(GASPS)
It is an honour, Mr President.
If you're gonna do it, do it!
Whoa! Cool your boots, sir.
That's not how the Mandarin works.
Sir, Air Force One
has been compromised.
Internal shots, temperature spikes.
Get me eyes on it now.
Image coming through now, sir.
Was that Rhodes?
-(BANGING)
- MAN: Is anyone there?
WOMAN: Let us out!
(GROANING)
(GRUNTS)
TONY: The President.
Now.
He's not here.

Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.
(ALL SCREAMING)
(SCREAMING)
How many in the air?
JARVIS: Thirteen, sir.
- How many can I carry?
- JARVIS: Four, sir.
Slow down. Slow down, relax.
What's your name? Heather?
(SCREAMING)
(SHRIEKING)
HEATHER: Oh, God! No! No!
TONY: Listen to me.
See that guy?
I'm gonna swing by,
you're just gonna grab him.
- You got it?
- What? Oh!
(HEATHER RESUMES SCREAMING)
I'll electrify your arm,
you won't be able to open your hand.
We can do this, Heather.
(HEATHER WHIMPERING)
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.
(SCREAMING)
Remember that game
called Barrel of Monkeys?
That's what we're going to do.
JARVIS: 18,000 feet.
Come on, people.
Everybody, grab your monkey.
Nice.
JARVIS: 10,000 feet.
(YELLING)
6,000 feet.
Come on, people.
Come on, come on, come on!
Yeah!
JARVIS: 1, 000 feet.
400 feet.
200 feet, sir.
TONY: He's a chunky monkey,
let's get him.
Hello.
(TONY STRAINING)
(PASSENGERS CHEERING)
MAN: We made it!
Nice work, guys!
Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.
All right, Jarvis.
But it's only half-done.
We've still got to get Pepper...
(SIGHING)
That came out of nowhere.
Wow.
Give me some good news, man.
I think they all made it.
Oh, thank God.
Yeah, but I missed the president.
You couldn't save the president
with the suit,
how are we gonna save Pepper
with nothing?
Uh... Say, Jarvis,
is it that time?
The House Party Protocol, sir?
Correct.
(GASPS)
Hi.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
You think he's gonna help you?
He won't.
Having you here is not
just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um...
Well, it's actually
more embarrassing than that.
You're here as my, um...
trophy-
(CHUCKLES) Mmm.
Good evening, sir.
(GASPS)
Welcome aboard, Mr President.
KILLIAN: Ever hear
of an elephant graveyard?
Well, two years ago,
the elephant in the room was this scow.
This is the Roxxon Norco.
And, of course, you'll remember
that when she spilled a million gallons
of crude off Pensacola,
thanks to you,
not one fat cat saw a day in court.
What do you want from me?
Uh, nothing, sir.
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.
You see, I've moved on.
I found myself
a new political patron,
and this time tomorrow,
he'll have your job.
String him up.
Hey!
(MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
Come on.
You're not gonna freak out on me,
right?
TONY: I hope not.
Oh, my God.
(SIGHS) He's strung up over the oil
tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.
Viking funeral.
Public execution.
Yeah, death by oil.
ANNOUNCER: (ON PA)
Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.
Okay. That's good.
Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.
(TECHNICIAN TYPING)
ls your gun UP?
Yep. What do I do?
Stay on my six, cover high
and don't shoot me in the back.
Six, high, back. All right.
(GUNFIRE)
(BULLETS RICOCHETING)
You see that? Nailed it.
Yeah, you really killed the glass.
You think I was aiming for the bulb?
You can't hit a bulb at this distance.
ANNOUNCER (ON PA):
All personnel, we have hostiles
-on east unit 12.
- MAN: Over there!
- I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.
- I'm out. Give me...
- You got extra magazines?
- They're not universal, Tony.
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Give me another one.
- One of yours.
- I don't have one that fits that gun.
You've got, like, five of them.
Here's what I'm going to do.
Save my spot, ready?
- What'd you see?
- Too fast. Nothing.
Here we go. (CLEARS THROAT)
(MEN GRUNTING)
Three guys, one girl, all armed.
God, I would kill
for some armour right now.
- You're right. We need backup.
- Yeah, a bunch.
You know what?
-(WHOOSHING)
- RHODEY: Is that...
Yep.
- Are those...
- Yeah.
Merry Christmas, buddy.
TONY: Jarvis, target
EXTREMIS heat signatures.
Disable with extreme prejudice.
JARVIS: (THROUGH ARMOURS)
Yes, sir.
What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.
Take them to church.
(SCREAMING)
JARVIS: Gentlemen.
-(GRUNTING)
-(SCREAMING)
(ALL GRUNTING)
(SCREAMS)
TONY: Incoming!
Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.
(MECHANISMS WHIRRING)
This is how you've been managing
your down time, huh?
Everybody needs a hobby.
Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out,
will you?
(GASPS)
TONY: Nice timing.
Oh, yeah. That's awesome.
Give me a suit, okay?
Oh, I'm sorry,
they're only coded to me.
What does that mean?
I got you covered.
JARVIS: Good evening, Colonel.
Can I give you a lift?
Very funny.
(GRUNTING)
(PANTING)
(BOTH SCREAM)
JARVIS: Sir, I've located Ms Potts.
About time.
(GASPS) Stop!
Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.
See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?
You're such a jerk.
Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.
-(METAL CREAKING)

Come on. A little more, baby.
(PEPPER STRAINING)
-(TONY GRUNTING)
- Oh!
(GROANS)
Is this guy bothering you?
Don't get up.
Ooh.
Is it hot in there?
(SIZZLING)
Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck?
Like a little turtle,
cooking in his little turtle suit.
Oh, Tony.
-(GRUNTS)
- She's watching.
I think you should close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
You don't want to see this.

Just hold on. Hold on.
(GRUNTING)

(GROWLING)
Okay.

TONY: Pep, I got you.
Relax, I got you.
-(SCREAMS)
- Just look at me!
(PEPPER GROANS)
Honey, I can't reach any
further and you can't stay there.
All right?
You've got to let go.
You've got to let go!
I'll catch you, I promise.

Well, here we are on the roof.
JARVIS: Mark 42, inbound.
I'll be damned.
The prodigal son returns.
Whatever.
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.
It's a pity.
I was so close to having her perfect.
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait!
Slow down! Slow down!
You're right. I don't deserve her.
Here's where you're wrong.
She was already perfect.
-(STRAINING)

do me a favour and blow Mark 42.
No...

(METAL CREAKING)
(GROANING)
No more false faces.
You said you wanted the Mandarin.
You're looking right at him.
It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.
I am the Mandarin!
(BREATHING HARD)
I got nothing.
(GRUNTING)
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!
(REPULSOR POWERING UP)
(GROWLS)
What?
Oh, what, are you mad at me?
(GRUNTING)
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Whoo!
(PANTING)
TONY: Honey?
Oh, my God.
That was really violent.
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?
Who's the hot mess now?
It's still debatable.
Probably tipping your way a little bit.
Why don't you dress
like this at home? Hmm?
Sport bra. The whole deal.
You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.
What am I going to complain
about now?
Well, it's me.
You'll think of something.
- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.
- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.
Not hot.
Am I gonna be okay?
No.
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.
I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.
I think I can get you better.
That's what I do. I fix stuff.
And all your distractions?
Uh... I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.
Jarvis. Hey.
JARVIS: All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?
You know what to do.
The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.
(KISSES)
Okay, so far?
Do you like it?
(SIGHS)
It'll do.
TONY: And so,
as Christmas morning began,
my journey had reached its end.
You start with something pure,
something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.
The compromises.
- We create our own demons.
-(REPORTERS CALLING)
- Oh!
-(ALL CLAMOURING)
Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!
TONY: As promised, I got Pepper
sorted out. It took some tinkering.
But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"
Of course, there are people who
say progress is dangerous,
but I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.
And now, neither will I.
- Let me tell you...
-(METAL CLINKING)
...that was the best sleep
I'd had in years.
(GASPING)
(COUGHING)
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
(WEAKLY) No, look.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
(LAUGHS)
TONY: So, if I were to wrap this up,
tie it with a bow, or whatever...
I guess I'd say my armour,
it was never a distraction,
or a hobby.
It was a cocoon.
And now,
I'm a changed man.
You can take away my house,
all my tricks and toys.
One thing you can't take away...
I am Iron Man.
(THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING)
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
TONY: You know, and thank you
by the way. For listening.
Plus, something about just getting it off
my chest,
and putting it out there in the
atmosphere, instead of holding this in...
I mean, this is what gets people sick,
you know.
Wow, I had no idea
you were such a good listener.
To be able to share
all my intimate thoughts
and my experiences with someone,
it just cuts the weight of it in half.
You know, it's like a snake
swallowing its own tail.
Everything comes full circle.
-(GASPS)
- And the fact that you've been able to
-help me process...
-(CLEARS THROAT)
- Are you with me?
- Sorry... I was, yeah.
We were at, uh...
Are you actively napping?
(STAMMERING)
I was... I... I drifted.
Where did I lose you?
Elevator in Switzerland.
So, you heard none of it.
I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.
I'm not a therapist.
- It's not my training.
- So?
- I don't have the...
- What? The time?
Temperament.
You know what?
Now that I think about it...
Oh! God, my original wound.
-1983, all right?
- Yes.
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny.
That was weird.
Lovingly cooked by Bakemstr
You the guys from Washington?
You get many other visitors out here?
How long you been on site?
Since this morning.
A Russian oil team called it in about 18 hours ago.
How come nobody's spotted it before?
It's really not that surprising.
This landscapes changing all the time.
You got any idea what this thing is exactly?
I don't know, it's probably a weather balloon.
I don't think so.
You know we don't have the
equipment for a job like this.
How long before we can start craning it out?
I don't think you quite understand.
You guys are going to need one hell of a crane.
Base, we're aft.
What is this?
Careful.
Lieutenant.
- What is it?
- My god.
Mays, give me a line to the Colonel.
It's 3am, sir.
I don't care what time it is.
This one's waited long enough.
Tnsberg, Norway
March - 1942
They've come for it.
They have before.
Not like this.
Let them come.
They'll never find it.
Open it.
Why can't you find it?
It has taken me a long time to find this place.
You should be commended.
Help him up.
I think that you are a man of great vision.
And in this way we are much alike.
I am nothing like you.
Of course but what others see as superstition,
you and I know to be of science.
What you seek is just a legend.
Then why make such an effort to conceal it?
The tesseract was the jewel
of Odin's treasure room.
It's not something one buries.
But I think it is close, yes.
I cannot help you.
No.
But maybe you can help your, uh village?
You must have some friends out there.
Some little grandchildren, perhaps.
You have no need for them to die.
Yggdrasil.
The Tree of the world.
Guardian of wisdom.
And fate for some.
And the Fhrer digs for trinkets in the desert.
You have never seen this.
Have you?
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.
Exactly.
Give the order to open fire.
Jawohl.
Fool.
You cannot control the power you hold.
You will burn.
I already have.
O'Connell, Michael.
Kaminski, Henry.
Boy a lot of guys getting killed over there.
Rogers, Stephen.
Kinda makes you think
twice about enlisting, huh?
Nope.
Rogers.
What did your father die of?
Mustard gas.
He was in the 107th infantry.
- I was hoping I could be assigned.
- Mother?
She was a nurse in a TB ward.
Got hit.
Couldn't shake it.
Sorry son.
Well just give me a chance.
You'll be ineligible on your asthma alone.
Is there anything you can do?
I'm doing it.
I'm saving your life.
War continues to ravage Europe.
But help is on the way.
Every able bodied young man is
lining up to serve his country.
Even little Timmy is doing his part.
Collecting scrap metal.
Nice work, Timmy.
Who cares!
Play the movie already.
Hey, want to show some respect.
Meanwhile, over seas...
..our brave boys are showing the axis powers...
..that the price of freedom is never to high.
Let's go, get on with it.
Hey, just start the cartoon.
Hey, you want to shut up.
Together with allied forces,
we'll face any threat, no matter the size.
You just don't know when to give up, do you.
I can do this all day.
Hey, pick on someone your own size.
Sometimes I think you like getting punched.
I had him on the ropes.
How many times is this?
Oh, your from Paramus now.
You know it's illegal to lie
on your enlistment form.
Seriously, Jersey?
You get your orders?
Sergeant James Barnes.
Shipping out for England first thing tomorrow.
I should be going.
Come on, man.
My last night.
Gotta get you cleaned off.
Why, where we going?
The future.
I don't see what the problem is.
You're about to be the last
eligible man in New York.
You know there's three and a half women here.
Yeah, I'd settle for just one.
Good thing I took care of that.
Hey, Bucky!
What'd you tell her about me?
Only the good stuff.
Welcome to the Modern Marvels Pavilion.
and the world of tomorrow.
A greater world.
A better world.
Oh my god.
It's starting.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Mr. Howard Stark.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
What if I told you that in just a few short years,
Your automobile won't even
have to touch the ground, at all.
Yes.
Thanks, Mandy.
With Starks Gravitic reversion technology.
You'll be able to do just that.
Holy cow.
Well I did say a few years, didn't I?
Hey, Steve.
What do you say we treat these girls...
Come on, Soldier.
Come on, kinda missing
the point of a double date.
We're taking the girls dancing.
You go ahead, I'll catch up with you.
You really gonna do this again?
Well it's a fair, I'm going to try my luck.
As who, Steve from Ohio?
They'll catch you or worse they'll actually take you.
Look I know you don't think I can do this.
This isn't a back alley, Steve, it's war.
- I know it's a war.
- Then find kin to fight,
..start looking for a job.
- What am I going to do, collect scrap.
- Yes, I know that I'm
I'm not going to sit in a factory, Bucky.
Bucky come on, there are
men laying down their lives.
I got no right to do any less than them.
That's what you don't understand.
This isn't about me.
Right.
'Cause you got nothing to prove.
Hey Barnes. Are we going dancing?
Yes we are.
Don't do anything stupid until I get back.
How can I?
You're taking all the stupid with you.
You're a punk.
Jerk.
Careful.
Don't win the war 'til I get there.
Come on girls, playing our song.
Wait here.
Is there a problem?
Just wait here.
Thank you.
So.
You want to go overseas.
Kill some Nazis.
Excuse me.
Doctor Abraham Erskine.
I represent a Strategic scientific research.
Steve Rogers.
Where are you from?
Queens.
Before that, Germany.
This troubles you?
No.
Where are you from, Mr. Rogers?
Hmm?
Is it, New Haven?
Or, Paramus?
Five exams in five different...
It might not be the right file.
It's not the exams I'm interested in.
It's the five tries.
But you didn't answer my question.
Do you want to kill Nazis?
Is this a test?
Yes.
I don't want to kill anyone.
I don't like bullies.
I don't care where they're from.
Well, there are already so many
big men fighting this war.
Maybe what we need now is a little guy.
Huh?
I can offer you a chance.
Only a chance.
I'll take it.
Good.
So where is the little guy from?
Actually.
Brooklyn.
Congratulations.
Soldier.
Are you ready, Doctor Zola?
The machine requires the most delicate calibration.
Forgive me if I seem over cautious.
Are you certain that those combatants of yours
...can withstand the energy surge,
...long enough for a transference?
With this artifact.
I am certain of nothing.
I fear it may not work at all.
Twenty percent.
Forty.
Sixty.
Stabilizing at seventy percent.
I have not come all this way,
...for safety, Doctor.
What was that?
I must congratulate you, Arnim.
Your designs does not disappoint.
Though they may require
some slight reinforcement.
Nothing has changed, it's stable.
Amazing.
The energy patch, you called it,
equipped all my designs.
All my designs.
This will change the war.
Don't think so, Zola.
This will change the world.
Recruits, attention!
Gentlemen, I'm Agent Carter.
I supervise all operations for this division.
What's with the accent, Queen Victoria?
Thought I was signing up for the U.S. army.
What's your name, soldier?
Gilmore Hodge, your majesty.
Step forward, Hodge.
Put your right foot forward.
We gonna wrestle?
'Cause I gotta a few moves I know you'll like.
Agent Carter.
Colonel Phillips.
I can see that you are breaking
in the candidates, that's good.
Get your ass up out of that dirt,
..and stand up in that lineup at attention until,
- ...somebody comes and tells you what to do.
- Yes, Sir.
General Patton.
Has said.
"War's are fought with weapons
but they are won by men."
We are going to win this war, because...
...we have the best men.
And because they're gonna get better.
Much, better.
The Strategic Scientific Reserve.
Is an allied effort.
Made up with the best minds of the free world.
Our goal.
Is to create the best army in history.
But every army starts with one man.
Rogers! Get up from there.
At the end of this week, we will chose that man.
He'll be the first.
Of a new breed of super soldiers.
Rogers, get your ass out of that line.
And they, will personally escort Adolph Hitler
Through the gates of hell.
Pick up the pace, sweeties.
Let's go, let's go.
Double time.
Come on, faster, faster.
Move.
Move.
Squad halt.
That flag means you're only at the half way point.
First man to bring it to me,
gets to ride back with Agent Carter.
Move, move!
Come on, get up there.
That's what you got?
This army is in trouble.
Get up there, Hodge.
Come on, get up there.
Nobody's got that flag in seventeen years.
Come on, come on, fall in.
Let's go, get back in formation.
Rogers!
I said, fall in.
Thank you, Sir.
Faster ladies, come on.
My grandmother has more life in her, God rest her soul.
Move it!
You're not really thinking
of picking Rogers, are you?
I am more than just thinking about it.
It is a clear choice.
When you brought a modicum
asthmatic onto my army base.
I let it slide. I thought what the hell.
Maybe he could be useful to you, like a gerbil.
- Never thought you'd pick him.
- Up.
Stick a needle in that kids arm,
it's going to go right through him.
Come on, girls.
Look at that.
He's making me cry.
I am looking for qualities beyond the physical.
Do you know how long it
took to set up this project.
-Yes.
- All the groveling I had to do in front...
...of Senator whats-his-name committees.
Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.
Then throw me a bone.
Hodge passed every test we gave him.
He's big, he's fast.
- He obeys orders, he's a soldier.
- He's a bully.
You don't win wars with niceness, Doctor.
You win wars, with guts.
Grenade!
Oh, no!
Stay away.
Get back.
Phony grenade.
Men, back in formation.
Is this a test?
He's still skinny.
- May I?
- Yeah.
Can't sleep?
Got the jitters I guess.
Oh, me too.
Can I ask you a question?
Just one?
Why me?
I suppose that is the one question that matters.
This is from Augsburg.
My City.
So many people forget that the first
country the Nazi's invaded was their own.
You know after the last war they,
My peoples struggled, they..they..
They felt weak, they felt..
...slow, then Hitler comes along.
With the marching and the big show,
and the flags and all that
And he, hears of me.
My work, and he finds me.
Then he says, you.
He says, you will make us strong.
Well.
I am not interested.
So he sends the head of Hydra.
East research division.
A brilliant Scientist by the name of, Johann Schmidt.
Now Schmidt is a member of the inner circle.
And he's ambitious.
Even Hitler shares his passion for,
occult power and tatanic myth.
Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers.
But for Schmidt it is not fantasy.
For him, it is real.
He has become convinced
that there is a great power.
Hidden in the earth.
Left here by the gods.
Waiting to be seized by superior men.
So when he has found my
formula and what it can do.
He cannot resist.
Schmidt wants to become that superior man.
Did it make him stronger?
Ja.
But, it has other effects.
The serum wasn't ready.
But more important.
The man.
The serum amplifies everything
that is inside, so..
Good becomes great.
Bad becomes worse.
This is why you were chosen.
Because a strong man.
Who has known power all his life.
They lose respect for that power.
But a weak man.
Who values of strength.
And loves
Compassion.
Thanks.
I think.
Give this.
Whatever happens tomorrow,
you must promise me one thing.
That you must stay who you are.
Not a perfect soldier.
But.
A good man.
To the little guys.
No, wait, wait. What am I doing?
No, you have procedure tomorrow.
No fluids.
All right, we'll drink it after.
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.
I can't after, I can now.
Is there something in particular you need?
I uh, understand you found him.
See for yourself.
You disapprove.
I just don't see why you
need concern yourself.
I can't imagine he'll succeed.
Again.
The serum is the allies only defense.
against this power we now possess.
If we take it away from them,
then our victory is assured.
I shall give the order.
It has been given.
Good.
Doctor Zola.
What do you think?
Masterpiece.
I know this neighborhood.
I got beat up in that alley.
And that parking lot.
And behind that dinner.
Did you have something against running away?
You start running they'll never let you stop.
You stand up, push back.
You can't say no forever, right.
I know a little of what that's like.
To have every door shut in your face.
I guess I just don't know why you
would want to join the army.
You're a beautiful dame.
Beautifu..oh a woman. I mean...
An agent, not a Dame.
- You are beautiful.
- You have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?
I think this is the longest
conversation I've had with a woman.
They're not exactly lining up to dance
with a guy that might step on them.
You must have danced.
Well, asking a woman to dance always seems so terrifying.
And the past few years just...
Didn't seem to matter that much.
Figured I'd wait.
For what?
Right partner.
This way.
What are we doing here?
Follow me.
Wonderful weather this morning.
- Isn't it.
- Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.
Good morning.
Please, not now.
You ready?
Good.
Take off your shirt your tie and your hat.
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?
We needed access to the cities power grid.
Of course if you had given
me a generalized requisition.
A lot of people are asking for funds, ....
Oh, this is Clem uh...
Gregg Clemson, state department.
If this project of yours comes through.
We'd like to see that it doesn't get into the headlines.
Jesus.
Somebody get that kid a sandwich.
Comfortable?
It's a little big.
You save me any of that schnapps?
Not as much as I should have.
Sorry, next time.
Mr. Stark.
How are your levels?
- Levels at 100%.
- Good.
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn.
But we are ready.
Good as we'll ever be.
Agent Carter, don't you think you would
be more comfortable in the booth?
Oh yes, ah, sorry.
Can you hear me, is this on?
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Today we take not another
step towards annihilation.
But the first step towards the path to peace.
We begin with a series of micro injections,
into the subjects major muscles.
The serum infusion will cause
immediate cellular change.
Then to stimulate growth.
The subject will be saturated,
...with Vita rays
That wasn't so bad.
That was penicillin.
Serum infusion.
Beginning in, five...
Four...
Three...
Two...
One.
Now, Mr. Stark.
Steven.
Can you hear me?
Probably to late to go to the bathroom, right?
We will proceed.
That's ten percent.
Twenty percent.
Thirty.
That's forty percent.
All signs are normal.
That's fifty percent.
Sixty.
Seventy.
Steven, Steven.
- Shut it down!
- Steven.
Shut it down.
Turn back, Mr. Stark. Turn it off kill it, turn back.
No!
Don't
I can do this.
Eighty...Ninety.
That's one hundred percent!
Mr. Stark.
Son of a bitch did it.
- I did it,
- Yes, yes.
I think we did it.
You actually did it.
How do you feel?
Taller.
You look taller.
How do we look now, Senator?
I guess the folks in Berlin
are about to get very nervous.
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.
Stop him!
- They're coming, come on.
- Now.
You all right? Hey!
This guy's been shot.
I had him.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Whoa, whoa.
No.
No, darling no.
Tommy no. Don't hurt him.
Go on.
Let me go.
No, don't hurt him.
Wait don't.
Don't.
No, don't.
Go get him, I can swim.
Who the hell are you?
The first of many.
I got off one hit.
Two more shall take it's place.
Heil Hydra.
The Fhrer is not accustomed to
being ignored, Herr Schmidt.
He funds your research because
you promised him weapons.
You serve at his pleasure.
He gave you this facility as
a reward for your injuries.
Reward, call it what it is, exile.
I no longer effect his image of Aryan perfection.
You think this is about appearances?
Your Hydra division has failed,
...to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year.
And we have learned through local intelligence.
You have mounted a full
scaled incursion into Norway.
The Fhrer fears, how does he put it?
The Red Skull has
been indulged long enough.
Gentlemen.
You have come to see the
results of our work, hmm?
Let me show you.
Hitler speaks of a thousand year Reich.
But he cannot feed his armies for a month.
His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe.
But still he is no closer to achieving his goals.
And I suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic.
Science, but I understand your confusion.
Great power has always baffled primitive men.
Hydra is assembling an arsenal that will
destroy my enemies in one stroke.
Wherever they are, regardless
of how many forces they possess.
All in a matter of hours.
Your enemies?
My weapons contain enough destructive power,
...to decimate every hostile capital on Earth.
Quite simply, gentlemen.
I have harnessed the power of the gods.
Thank you, Schmidt.
For what?
For making it clear how obviously mad you are.
Berlin is on this map!
So it is.
You will be punished for your insolence.
You will be brought before the Fhrer and ....
My apologies, Doctor.
But we both knew Hydra could
grow no further in Hitler's shadow.
Heil Hydra.
Heil Hydra!
Heil Hydra.
Think you got enough?
Any hope of reproducing the
program is locked in your genetic code
But without Erskine it would take years.
He deserved more than this.
If it could work only once.
He'd be proud of you.
Colonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.
Great, why don't we start with how a German spy,
..got a ride to my secret installation in your car?
What do we got here?
Speaking modestly I'm the best
mechanical engineer in this country.
But I don't know what's inside this thing.
Or how it works.
We're not even close to this technology.
Then who is?
Hydra, I'm sure you've been reading our briefings.
I'm on a number of committees, Colonel.
Hydra is a Nazi Deep science division.
It's led by Johann Schmidt.
But he has much bigger ambitions.
Hydra's practically a cult, they worship Schmidt,
they think he's invincible.
So what are you going to do about it?
I spoke to the President this morning.
As of today, the S.S.R. is being retasked.
- Colonel?
- We are taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.
You too, sir.
We're flying to London tonight.
Sir.
If you're going after Schmidt, I want in.
Your an experiment, you're going to Alamogordo.
The serum worked.
I asked for an army, and all I got was you.
You.
You're not enough.
With all due respect to the Colonel.
I think we may be missing the point.
I've seen you in action, Steve.
More importantly.
The countries seen it.
Paper.
The enlistment lines have been around the block
since your picture hit the news stands.
You don't take a soldier, a symbol like that.
And hide him in a Lab.
Son.
You want to serve your country.
On the most important battlefield of the war.
Sir.
That's all I want.
Than congratulations.
You just got promoted.
I don't know if I can do this.
Nothing to it.
Sell a few bonds, bonds buy's bullets.
Bullets kill Nazi's, bing, bang, boom.
You're an American hero.
It's just I don't think I'm getting there.
The senator's got a lot of pull up on the hill.
You play ball, with us.
You'll be leading your own platoon in no time.
That's you.
Go!
Who's strong and brave,
here to save the American way.
Not all of us can storm a beach.
Or drive a tank.
But there's still a way all of us can fight.
Who loves to fight like the
man for whats right by day.
Series E Defense bonds.
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guys gun.
Who built and came door to door for America?
Carries the flag shore to shore for America.
From Hoboken to Spokane.
The Star Spangled Man, with the plan.
Cut.
All right, don't look at the camera.
We can't ignore there's a
threat and the warning is big.
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guys gun.
Who'll hang the noose on the
goose that we loosed from Berlin.
Who will redeem heed the call for America.
Who buys it all, gives his all for America.
Who stands to prove that task.
The Star Spangled Man, with the plan.
We all know it's about trying to win the war.
We can't do that without bullets and bandages.
Tanks and casts.
And that's where you come in.
Every bond you buy will help
protect someone you love.
Look out there, he's there behind you.
The Germans will think twice
about trying to get the drop on us.
Stalwart, and steady and true.
See how this guy can shoot!
We can tell that there's no substitute
Forceful and ready to defend
the Red, White and Blue!
Who'll give the Axis the sack
and is smart as a fox?
Far as an eagle we'll soar.
Who's making Adolph afraid
to step out of his bunk?
He knows what we're fighting for.
Who waked the giant that napped in America?
We know it's no one but, Captain America.
Who'll finish what they began?
Who'll kick the krauts to Japan?
The Star Spangled Man.
With the...
Plaaaaaaaaaan.
How many of you are ready
to help me sock ol' Adolph on the jaw?
Okay.
I need a volunteer.
We already volunteered,
how do you think I got here?
Bring back the girls.
I think they only know the one song.
But, um...
Let me...I'll see what I can do.
You do that, sweetheart.
Nice boots, Tinkerbell.
Come on guys.
We're all on the same team here.
Hey, Captain.
Sign this.
Don't worry about it, they'll warm up to you.
Don't worry.
Hello Steve.
Hi.
- Hi
- What are you doing here?
Officially I'm not here at all.
That was quite a performance.
Yeah, uh...
I had to improvise a little bit.
The crowds I'm used to are usually more, uh...
- Proud.
- I understand you're America's new hope.
Bond sales take a ten percent
bump on every state I visit.
That's Senator Brandt's idea.
At least he's got me doing this.
Phillips would have had me stuck in a lab.
And these are you only two options?
A lab rat or a dancing monkey.
You were meant for more than this, you know.
What?
You know, for the longest time I dreamed about,
...coming over seas and...
..being on the front lines.
Serving my country.
Finally got everything I wanted.
And I'm wearing tights.
Look like they've been through hell.
These men move the most.
Schmidt sent out a force to a zone.
Less than 50 returned.
Your audience contained
what was left of the 107th.
The rest were killed or captured.
The 107th?
What?
Come on.
- Colonel Phillips.
- Well if it isn't the Star Spangled Man with the plan.
What is your plan today?
I need the causality list from Bolzano.
You don't get to give me orders, son.
I just need one name.
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.
You and I are going to have a conversation
later that you won't enjoy.
Please tell me he's alive, sir.
B-A-R...
I can spell.
I've signed more of these condolence
letters today than I would care to count.
But...
The name does sound familiar.
I'm sorry.
What about the others?
Are you planning a rescue mission?
Yeah, it's called winning the war.
But if you know where they are, why not...
They're thirty miles behind the lines.
Through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in Europe.
We'd lose more men than we'd save.
I don't expect you to understand that,
because you're a chorus girl.
I think I understand just fine.
Well then understand it somewhere else.
If I read the posters correctly, you've got
someplace to be in thirty minutes.
Yes, sir.
I do.
If you have something to say, right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.
What do plan to do, walk to Austria.
If that's what it takes.
You heard the Colonel,
your friend is most likely dead.
You don't know that.
Even so, he's devising a strategy, it takes time.
By the time he's done that, it could be to late.
Steve.
You told me you thought I
was meant for more than this.
Did you mean that?
Every word.
Then you gotta let me go.
I can do more than that.
On stage, girls.
Where's my helmet?
Anyone seen, Rogers?
The Hydra camp is in
Krossberg.
It's up between these two mountain ranges.
It's a factory of some kind.
We should be able to drop you
around the doorstep.
Just get me as close as you can.
You know you two are going
to be in a lot of trouble when you land.
- And you won't.
- Where I'm going if any anybody,
...yells at me I can just shoot them.
And they will undoubtedly shoot back.
Well lets hope this is good for something.
Agent Carter.
If you're not in too much of a hurry I thought
we could stop off in Usurea
for a late night Fondue.
Stark is the best civilian pilot I've ever seen.
He's mad enough to brave this air space.
We're lucky to have him.
So you two?
Do you?
Fondue?
This is your transponder,
active it when you're ready.
And the signal will lead us straight to you.
Are you sure this thing works?
It tested more than you, pal.
Get back here, we're taking you all the way there.
I'm jumping this plane, turn this thing
around and get the hell out of here.
You can't give me orders.
The hell I can't.
I'm a Captain.
As you can see.
Production and the work here is progressing on schedule.
Even with components of this size.
Increase the output by sixty percent.
And speak with our other facilities to do the same.
But these prisoners, I'm not
sure they have the strength.
Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor.
There are always more workers.
Not now.
You know, Fritz.
One of these days I'm going
to have a stick of my own.
Fellas.
Who are you suppose to be?
Um...
Captain America.
I, beg your pardon?
What are we taking, everybody?
I'm from Fresno, ace.
There anybody else?
I'm looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.
There's an isolation ward in the factory.
No one's ever come back from it.
All right.
The tree line is northwest,
it's eighty yards past the gate.
Get out fast, and give them hell.
I'll meet you guys in the
clearing with anybody else I find.
- Wait.
- You know what you're doing?
Yeah. I knocked out Adolph Hitler over 200 times.
You know how to use that thing?
Okay.
What is happening?
Hey.
Not exactly a Buick.
- That's Zndung. (Ignition)
- Zndung?
Get going, Dum Dum.
I didn't know you spoke German.
I recently mastered at Le Havre.
Plus the French girls much cuter.
Get after the Russian babes.
No, no, what are you doing?
Our forces are out matched.
Keep moving.
Grab a grenade.
Bucky.
Oh my God.
It's me, it's Steve.
Steve.
- Come on.
- Steve.
I thought you were dead.
I thought you were smaller?
Come on.
What happened to you?
I joined the army.
Did it hurt?
A little.
- Permanent?
- So far.
Captain America.
How exciting.
I am a great fan of your films.
So Doctor Erskine managed it after all.
Not exactly an improvement, but, still.
Impressive.
You've got no idea.
Haven't I.
No matter what lies Erskine told you.
You see I was his greatest success.
You don't have one of those, do you?
You are deluded, Captain.
You pretend to be a simple soldier.
But in reality you are just afraid to admit,
...that we have left humanity behind.
Men like you.
They embrace it proudly.
No fear.
Then how come you're running?
Come on, let's go.
Sir, we go to the roof?
What about me?
Where will I sit?
Not a scratch, Doctor.
Not a scratch.
Let's go.
One at a time.
Gotta get a rope or something.
Just go, get out of here.
No, not without you.
SENATOR BRANDT, I REGRET TO INFORM YOU,
...CAPTAIIN STEPHEN G. ROGERS
...WENT MISSING BEHIND ENEMY LINES,
...ON THE THIRD AREA.
RECONNASANCE HAS PROVEN
...UNFRUITFUL AS A RESULT,
...I MUST DECLARE CAPTAIN ROGERS,
...KILLED IN ACTION.
PERIOD.
The last surveillance flight is back.
No sign of activity.
- Go get a cup of coffee, corporal.
- Yes, sir.
We can't touch Stark, he's rich.
And he's the army's number
one weapons contractor.
- You are neither one.
- With respect, sir.
I don't regret my actions.
And I don't think Captain Rogers did, either.
What makes you think I give
a damn about your opinions.
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.
And now America's golden boy,
and a lot of other good men are dead.
'Cause you had a crush.
It wasn't that.
I had faith.
Well I hope that's a big comfort to you,
...when they shut this division down.
There they are, I can't believe it.
What the hell's going on out there?
Some of these men need medical attention.
Medic, I got wounded.
I'd like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.
That won't be necessary.
Yes, Sir.
Faith, huh?
You're late.
Couldn't call my ride.
Hey!
Let's hear it for, Captain America.
I am honored to present,
...this medal for valor.
To my personal friend.
Captain America.
Captain America?
Captain, that's your cue.
I thought he'd be taller.
They one here in Poland, and the Baltic.
and the sixth one was...
About...
...here. 30, 40 miles west of the maginal line.
I just got a quick look.
Well nobodys' perfect.
These are the weapon factories we about.
Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra
shipped all the parts to another facility,
...that isn't on this map.
Agent Carter co-ordinate with MI6.
I want every allied eyeball looking
for that main Hydra base.
What about us?
We are going to set a
fire under Johann Schmidt's ass.
What do say, Rogers?
It's your map. You think you
can wipe Hydra off of it?
Yes, Sir.
I'll need a team.
We're already putting together the best men.
With all due respect, Sir.
So am I.
So let's get this straight.
We barely got out of there alive,
and you want us to go back?
Pretty much.
Sounds rather, fun actually.
(Burp) I'm in.
(Speaking French)
We're in.
Hell, I'll always play.
But you gotta do one thing for me.
What's that?
Open a tab.
Well that was easy.
Another round.
Where are they putting all this stuff?
There is a tavern in the town..
- See, told you.
They are all idiots.
What about you?
You ready to follow Captain America
into the jowls of death?
Hell, no.
That little guy from Brooklyn.
I was too.
I don't like to run away from a fight.
I'm following him.
Hey, you keeping your outfit, right?
You know what?
It's kinda growing on me.
And remember that the best of
friends must part, must part
Adieu, adieu...
- Captain.
- Agent Carter.
Ma'am.
Howard has some equipment for you to try.
- Tomorrow morning.
- Sounds good.
I see your top squad is prepping for duty.
You don't like music?
I do, actually.
I might even, when this is all over,
...go dancing.
Then what are we waiting for?
The right partner.
Pay attention, Captain.
Yes, Ma'am.
I'll be there.
I'm invisible.
I'm turning into you.
It's a horrible dream.
Don't take it so hard.
Maybe she's got a friend.
Initial signature is unusual.
Alpha beta remain neutral.
No doubt Rogers picked up on that.
Seems harmless enough.
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.
Write that down.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Mr. Stark.
He's in with Colonel Phillips.
Oh, of course you're welcome to wait.
I uh,
Read about what you did.
Oh, that...yeah.
Well that's, you know...
Just doing what needed to be done.
Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.
Really, it's not a big deal.
Tell that to their wives.
Uh, I don't think they were all married.
You're a hero.
Well, that...you know.
Tha..that depends on the definition of...
And the Women of America.
They owe you their thanks.
And um, seeing as they're not here.
Captain!
We're ready for you.
If you're not otherwise occupied.
Agent Carter, wait.
Looks like finding a partner
wasn't that hard after all.
Hey, that's not what you thought it was.
I don't think anything, Captain.
Not one thing.
Always wanted to be a soldier, and now you are.
Just like all the rest.
Well what about you and Stark?
How do I know you two haven't been...
...fondueing.
You still don't know a
bloody thing about women.
Fondue's just cheese and bread, my friend.
Really?
- I didn't think...
- Or should you, pal.
The moment you think you know what's going on in...
a woman's head. Is the moment your
goose is well and truly cooked.
Me, I concentrate on work.
Which at the moment, is about making sure
you and your men do not get killed.
Carbon polymer.
Should withstand your average German bayonet.
Although, Hydra's not going to attack
you with a pocket knife.
I hear you're uh, kinda attached.
It's handier than you might think.
I took the liberty of coming up with some options.
This one's fun.
She's being fitted with electrical relays.
- That will allow you to..
- What about this one?
No, no that's just a prototype.
What's it made of?
Vibranium.
It's stronger than steel, and a third of the weight.
It's completely vibration absorbent.
How come it's not standard issue?
That's the rarest metal on Earth.
What you're holding there.
That's all we got.
Are you quite finished, Mr. Stark?
I'm sure the Captain has some unfinished business.
What do you think?
Yes, I think it works.
I had some ideas about the uniform.
Whatever you want, pal.
You are failing!
We are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet.
And we are continually delayed because,
...you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield.
It's hardly my area of expertise.
I, I merely develop weapons.
I..I..I cannot fire them.
Finish your mission, Doctor.
Before the American finishes his.
Sir!
I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.
We fought to the last man.
Evidently not.
Remember when I made you
ride the Cyclone on Coney Island?
Yeah, and I threw up.
This isn't pay back, is it?
Now why would I do that?
You were right, Doctor Zola is on the train.
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission
to open up the throttle.
Wherever he's going, they must need him bad.
Let's get going because
they're moving like the devil.
We only got about a ten second window.
You miss that, window.
We're bugs on a windshield.
Mind the gap.
Gotta get moving, buds.
Maintenant. (Now)
Now!
Stop him.
Fire again.
I had him on the ropes.
I know you did.
Get down!
Fire again.
Kill him, now.
Bucky!
Hang on.
Grab my hand.
No!
So.
What is this?
Steak.
What is in it?
Cow.
Doctor, do you realize,
...how difficult it is to get a hold,
...of a prime cut like that out here?
I don't eat meat.
- Why not?
- It disagrees with me.
How about Cyanide, does
that give you the rumbly tummy too?
Every Hydra agent that
we've tried to take alive,
..has crushed a little pill before we can stop them.
But not you.
So, here's my brilliant theory.
You want to live.
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.
I brought you dinner.
Given the valuable information that he has provided,
And in exchange for his full co-operation.
Doctor Zola is being remanded to Switzerland.
I sent that message to Washington this morning.
Of course it was encoded.
You guys haven't broken
those codes, have you?
That would be awkward.
Schmidt will know this is a lie.
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.
You're a liability.
You know more about Schmidt than anyone.
And...
And the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers closest friend.
So I wouldn't count on the very best of protection.
It's you,
...or Schmidt.
It's just the hand you've been dealt.
Schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.
Hmm.
Only the world itself will satisfy him.
You do realize that's nuts, don't you.
Of course.
The certainty of the plan is of no consequence.
- And why is that?
- Because he can do it.
What's his target?
He's darkened.
He's everywhere.
Tomorrow...
Hydra will stand master of the world.
Born to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie.
Our enemies weapons will be powerless against us.
If they shoot down one plane.
Hundreds more will rain fire upon them.
Where they cut off one hand.
Two more shall take it's place.
Heil Hydra.
Heil Hydra!
HEIL HYDRA!
Heil Hydra...Heil Hydra!
Heil Hydra,
Heil Hydra!
Heil Hydra.
Doctor Erskine said that,
...the serum wouldn't just affect my muscles.
It would affect my cells.
Create a protective system,
..of regeneration and healing.
Which means, um...
I can't get drunk.
Did you know?
Your metabolism burns four times
faster than the average person.
He thought it could be one of the side effects.
It wasn't your fault.
Did you make the report?
Yes.
Well, then you know that's not true.
You did everything you could.
Did you believe in your friend?
Did you respect him?
Then stop blaming yourself.
And that was the dignity of his choice.
He damn well must have
thought you were worth it.
I'm going after Schmidt.
I'm not going to stop 'til all
of Hydra is dead, or captured.
You won't be alone.
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bug house.
He thinks he's a god and he's willing to
blow up half the world to prove it.
Starting with the U.S.A.
Schmidt's working with powers
beyond our capabilities.
He gets across the Atlantic.
He'll wipe out the entire
eastern seaboard in an hour.
How much time we got?
According to my new best friend,
in twenty four hours.
Where is he now?
Hydra's last base is here.
In the Alps.
So what are we suppose to do?
It's not like we can just knock on the front door.
Why not?
That's exactly what we're going to do.
Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait.
But I must say you do it better than anyone.
But, there are limits, to what
even you can do, Captain.
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?
He told me you were insane.
Ah.
He resented my genius,
and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine.
But he gave you everything.
So.
What made you so special?
Nothing.
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.
I can do this all day.
Oh of course you can, of course.
But unfortunately I am on a tight schedule.
So am I.
Rogers.
You might need this.
Thanks.
We're in, assault Team now!
Fire!
I'm hit, full force.
Let's go find ten more.
Cease fire.
You're late.
Weren't you about to...
Right.
Get in.
Keep it steady.
Wait!
Go get him.
I'm not kissing you.
You don't give up, do you?
Nope.
You could have the power of the gods.
Yet you wear a flag on your chest and think
you fight a battle of nations.
I have seen the future, Captain.
- There are no flags.
- Not my future.
What have you done?
No!
Come in this is, Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?
Captain Rogers, what is your...
Steve is that you, are you all right?
Great, Schmidt's dead.
What about the plane?
That's a little bit tougher to explain.
Give me your coordinates I'll
find you a safe landing site.
There's not going to be a safe landing.
I'm going to try and force it down.
I'll get Howard on the line, he'll know what to do.
There's not enough time.
This thing's moving to fast and
it's heading for New York.
I gotta put her in the water.
Please, don't do this.
We have time, we can work it out.
Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.
If I wait any longer a lot
of people are going to die.
Peggy.
This is my choice.
Peggy.
I'm here.
I'm going to need a rain check on that dance.
All right.
A week next Saturday at the Stork Club.
You got it.
Eight Oclock, on the dot.
Don't you dare be late.
Understood?
You know I still don't know how to dance.
I'll show you how.
Just be there.
We'll have the band play something slow.
I'd hate to step on your....
Steve?
Steve.
Steve.
To the Captain.
Sir.
Take us to the next grid point.
But there's no trace of wreckage.
And the energy signal trace stops here.
Just keep looking.
There's a pitch, it's a ball high outside.
So, the dodges tied four to four.
At the count no doubt, one swing of his bat.
This fella is capable of making it
a brand new game again
Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets field.
Philly's have managed to tie it up four to four.
But the Dodgers have three men on.
Pitch, it's a strike.
He leans in, here's the pitch,
swung on, it's a line drive.
It gets past Grissom.
Rizzo will score, Reiser heads to third.
Durocher is going to wave him in.
They look to relay but they hold steady.
- Pete Reiser with an inside the park...
- Good Morning.
Or should I say, afternoon.
Oh my god.
Where am I?
You're in a recovery room in New York city.
The Dodgers take the lead, it's eight to four
Oh ho, dodgers!
What a game we have here today, folks.
Fine game indeed.
Where am I really?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
The game.
It's from May, 1941
I know, 'cause I was there.
Now I'm going to ask you again.
Where am I?
- Captain Rogers
- Who are you?
Captain Rogers, wait.
All agents, code 13.
...13, all agents code 13.
At ease, soldier.
Look I'm sorry about that
little show back there, but.
We thought it best to break it to you slowly.
Break what?
You've been asleep, Cap.
For almost seventy years.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, just...
I had a date.
Longing
Rusted
Seventeen
Daybreak
Furnace
Nine
Benign
Homecoming
One
Freight car
Good morning, Soldier.
Ready to comply.
I have a mission for you.
Sanction and extract.
No witnesses.
Well done Soldier.
All right, what do you see?
Standard beat cops.
Small station.
Quiet street.
It's a good target.
There's an ATM on the
south corner, which means?
Cameras.
Both cross streets are one-way.
So, compromised escape routes.
Means our guy doesn't
care about being seen.
He isn't afraid
to make a mess on the way out.
You see that Range Rover
halfway up the block?
Yeah, the red one? It's cute.
It's also bulletproof,
which means private security...
which means more guns, which means more
headaches for somebody. Probably us.
You guys know
I can move things with my mind, right?
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become second nature.
Anybody ever tell you
you're a little paranoid?
Not to my face.
Why? Did you hear something?
Eyes on target, folks.
This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow
in six months. I don't want to lose him.
If he sees us coming,
that won't be a problem.
He kind of hates us.
Sam...
see that garbage truck?
Tag it.
Give me X-ray.
That truck's loaded for max weight.
And the driver's armed.
It's a battering ram.
- Go now.
- What?
He's not hitting the police.
Body armour, AR-15s.
I make seven hostiles.
I make five.
Sam.
Four.
Rumlow's on the third floor.
Wanda, just like we practised.
What about the gas?
Get it out.
Pack it up.
He's here.
Rumlow has a biological weapon.
I'm on it.
I don't work like that no more.
Fire in the hole.
No!
Sam.
He's in an AFV heading north.
Take this to the airstrip.
We're not gonna outrun them.
Lose the truck.
Where are you going to meet us?
I'm not.
I've got four, they're splitting up.
I got the two on the left.
They ditched their gear.
It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.
There you are, you son of a bitch.
I've been waiting for this.
He doesn't have it.
I'm empty!
Out of the way!
Drop it.
Or I'll drop this.
- Drop it!
- He'll do it!
Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.
Don't thank me.
I'm not thanking that thing.
His name is Redwing.
I'm still not thanking it.
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.
Come on!
This is for dropping
a building on my face.
Ahh!
I think I look pretty good,
all things considered.
Who's your buyer?
You know, he knew you.
Your pal, your buddy, your Bucky.
What did you say?
He remembered you.
I was there. He got all weepy about it.
Till they put his brain back in a blender.
He wanted you to know something.
He said to me...
"Please tell Rogers.
"When you gotta go...
"you gotta go."
And you're coming with me.
Oh, my...
Sam...
we need Fire and Rescue
on the south side of the building.
We gotta get up there.
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green
Wake up, dear,
and say goodbye to your father.
Who's the homeless person on the couch?
This is why
I love coming home for Christmas...
right before you leave town.
Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad.
Really? Which broad? What's her name?
Candice.
Do me a favour?
Try not to burn
the house down before Monday.
Okay, so it's Monday.
That is good to know,
I will plan my toga party accordingly.
Where you going?
Your father's flying us
to the Bahamas for a little getaway.
We might have to make a quick stop.
At the Pentagon. Right?
Don't worry, you're gonna love
the holiday menu at the commissary.
They say sarcasm
is a metric for potential.
If that's true,
you'll be a great man someday.
I'll get the bags.
He does miss you when you're not here.
And frankly, you're going to miss us.
Because this is the last time
we're all going to be together.
You know what's about to happen.
Say something.
If you don't, you'll regret it.
I love you, Dad.
And I know you did the best you could.
That's how I wish it happened.
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing...
or BARF.
God, I gotta work on that acronym.
An extremely costly method
of hijacking the hippocampus...
to clear traumatic memories.
Huh.
It doesn't change the fact that they
never made it to the airport...
or all the things I did to avoid
processing my grief, but...
Plus, $611 million for my
little therapeutic experiment?
No one in their right mind
would've ever funded it.
Help me out,
what's the MIT mission statement?
"To generate, disseminate...
"and preserve knowledge.
"And work with others...
"to bring it to bear on
the world's great challenges."
Well, you are the others.
And, quiet as it's kept...
the challenges facing you
are the greatest mankind's ever known.
Plus, most of you are broke.
Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were.
As of this moment...
every student has been made
an equal recipient...
of the inaugural
September Foundation Grant.
As in...
all of your projects have
just been approved and funded.
No strings, no taxes...
just reframe the future!
Starting now.
Go break some eggs.
Wow. Wow.
That took my breath away.
Oh, Tony! So generous.
So much money! Wow!
Out of curiosity...
will any portion of that grant
be made available to faculty?
I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out.
I have got this killer idea
for a self-cooking hotdog.
Basically, chemical detonator embedded...
Restroom's this way, yeah?
Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.
Mr Stark, I am so sorry
about the teleprompter.
I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled.
They didn't have time to fix it.
It's fine. I'll be right back.
We'll catch up later.
That was nice,
what you did for those young people.
Ah, they deserve it.
Plus, it helps ease my conscience.
They say there's a correlation
between generosity and guilt.
But if you've got the money...
break as many eggs as you like.
Right?
Are you going up?
I'm right where I want to be.
Okay. Hey.
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
I work for the State Department.
Human Resources.
I know it's boring...
but it enabled me to raise a son.
I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.
His name was Charlie Spencer.
You murdered him.
In Sokovia.
Not that that matters in the least to you.
You think you fight for us?
You just fight for yourself.
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?
He's dead...
and I blame you.
11 Wakandans were among
those killed during a confrontation...
between the Avengers
and a group of mercenaries...
in Lagos, Nigeria last month.
The traditionally reclusive Wakandans
were on an outreach mission...
in Lagos, when the attack occurred.
Our people's blood is spilled
on foreign soil...
not only because of
the actions of criminals...
but by the indifference
of those pledged to stop them.
Victory at the expense of the innocent...
is no victory at all.
The Wakandan king went on to...
They are operating outside
and above the international law.
Because that's the reality,
if we don't respond to acts like these.
What legal authority does an enhanced
individual like Wanda Maximoff have...
to operate in Nigeri...?
It's my fault.
That's not true.
Turn the TV back on.
They're being very specific.
I should've clocked that bomb vest
long before you had to deal with it.
Rumlow said "Bucky"...
and all of a sudden
I was a 16-year-old kid again,
in Brooklyn.
And people died.
It's on me.
It's on both of us.
This job...
We try to save as many people as we can.
Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody.
But if we can't find a way
to live with that...
then next time...
maybe nobody gets saved.
Vis! We talked about this.
Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...
Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr Stark was arriving.
Thank you. We'll be right down.
I'll use the door.
Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.
We know who it is?
The Secretary of State.
Five years ago...
I had a heart attack...
and dropped right in
the middle of my backswing.
Turned out it was the best
round of my life...
because after 13 hours
of surgery and a triple bypass...
I found something 40 years
in the Army had never taught me.
Perspective.
The world owes the Avengers
an unpayable debt.
You have fought for us...
protected us, risked your lives...
but while a great many people
see you as heroes...
there are some...
who would prefer the word "vigilantes."
What word would you use, Mr Secretary?
How about "dangerous"?
What would you call a group
of US-based, enhanced individuals...
who routinely ignore sovereign borders...
and inflict their will
wherever they choose...
and who, frankly, seem unconcerned
about what they leave behind?
New York.
Washington, D.C.
Sokovia.
Lagos.
Okay. That's enough.
For the past four years,
you've operated with unlimited power...
and no supervision.
That's an arrangement the governments
of the world can no longer tolerate.
But I think we have a solution.
The Sokovia Accords.
Approved by 117 countries...
it states that the Avengers
shall no longer be a private organisation.
Instead...
they'll operate under the supervision
of a United Nations panel...
only when and if that panel
deems it necessary.
The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.
I feel we've done that.
Tell me, Captain, do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?
If I misplaced a couple of
30 megaton nukes...
you can bet there'd be consequences.
Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.
Believe me, this is the middle ground.
So, there are contingencies.
Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...
to ratify the Accords.
Talk it over.
And if we come
to a decision you don't like?
Then you retire.
Hello?
Is this your car out front?
I jumped the kerb.
Maybe we could...
take care of it ourselves.
If you wanna call the cops,
that's okay, too...
- I guess.
- No.
No cops.
Thank you.
You have kept your looks, Colonel.
Congratulations.
"Mission report. December 16, 1991."
Who are you?
My name is Zemo.
I will repeat my question.
Mission report, December 16, 1991.
How did you find me?
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell...
Black Widow released
HYDRA files to the public.
Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted.
Not easy to decipher.
But, I have experience.
And patience.
A man can do anything if he has those.
What do you want?
Mission report.
December 16.
Go... to... hell!
HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap.
So your death would not bother me.
But I'd have to use this book...
and other bloodier methods
to find what I need.
I don't look forward to that.
You'd only be dying for...
your pride.
Hail HYDRA.
Secretary Ross has
a Congressional Medal of Honour...
which is one more than you have.
So let's say we agree to this thing.
How long is it gonna be before they
LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?
117 countries want to sign this.
117, Sam, and you're just like,
"No, that's cool. We got it."
How long are you going to play both sides?
I have an equation.
Oh, this will clear it up.
In the eight years since Mr Stark
announced himself as Iron Man...
the number of known enhanced persons
has grown exponentially.
During the same period...
the number of potentially
world-ending events
has risen at a commensurate rate.
Are you saying it's our fault?
I'm saying there may be a causality.
Our very strength invites challenge.
Challenge incites conflict.
And conflict...
breeds catastrophe.
Oversight...
Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand.
Boom.
Tony.
You are being uncharacteristically
non-hyperverbal.
It's because he's already
made up his mind.
Boy, you know me so well.
Actually, I'm nursing
an electromagnetic headache.
That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.
It's discomfort.
Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?
Am I running a bed and breakfast
for a biker gang?
Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way.
He's a great kid.
Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA...
had a floor-level gig
at Intel planned for the fall.
But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul...
before he parked it
behind a desk. See the world.
Maybe be of service.
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or
Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do.
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.
He decided to spend his summer building
sustainable housing for the poor.
Guess where. Sokovia.
He wanted to make a difference, I suppose.
We won't know because we dropped
a building on him while we were kicking ass.
There's no decision-making process here.
We need to be put in check!
Whatever form that takes, I'm game.
If we can't accept limitations,
if we're boundary-less...
we're no better than the bad guys.
Tony, someone dies on your watch,
you don't give up.
Who said we're giving up?
We are if we're not
taking responsibility for our actions.
This document just shifts the blame.
I'm sorry, Steve.
That is dangerously arrogant.
This is the United Nations
we're talking about.
It's not the World Security Council,
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA.
No, but it's run by people
with agendas, and agendas change.
That's good. That's why I'm here.
When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...
I shut it down and stopped manufacturing.
Tony, you chose to do that.
If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.
What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?
What if there is somewhere we need
to go and they don't let us?
We may not be perfect,
but the safest hands are still our own.
If we don't do this now,
it's gonna be done to us later.
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
You're saying they'll come for me.
We would protect you.
Maybe Tony's right.
If we have one hand on the wheel,
we can still steer. If we take it off...
Aren't you the same woman who told the
government to kiss her ass a few years ago?
I'm just reading the terrain.
We have made some very public mistakes.
We need to win their trust back.
Focus up. I'm sorry.
Did I just mishear you...
- or did you agree with me?
- I want to take it back now.
No, you can't retract it.
Thank you. Unprecedented.
Okay. Case closed. I win.
I have to go.
And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carter
to come up and say a few words.
Margaret Carter was known to most
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...
but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.
She had a photograph in her office.
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.
As a kid, that was pretty cool.
But it was a lot to live up to.
Which is why I never told
anyone we were related.
I asked her once how she managed
to master diplomacy and espionage...
in a time when no one wanted to see
a woman succeed at either.
She said, compromise where you can.
But where you can't, don't.
Even if everyone is telling you
that something wrong is something right.
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...
it is your duty to plant
yourself like a tree...
look them in the eye and say
"No, you move."
When I came out of the ice, I thought
everyone I had known was gone.
Then I found out she was alive.
I was just lucky to have her.
She had you back, too.
Who else signed?
Tony, Rhodey, Vision.
Clint?
Says he's retired.
- Wanda?
- TBD.
I'm off to Vienna
for the signing of the Accords.
There's plenty of room on the jet.
Just because it's the path
of least resistance...
doesn't mean it's the wrong path.
Staying together is more important
than how we stay together.
What are we giving up to do it?
I'm sorry, Nat.
I can't sign it.
I know.
Then what are you doing here?
I didn't want you to be alone.
Come here.
At a special United Nations conference...
117 countries have come together
to ratify the Sokovia Accords.
Excuse me, Ms Romanoff?
- Yes?
- These need your signature.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
I suppose neither of us
is used to the spotlight.
Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.
You seem to be doing all right so far.
Considering your last trip
to Capitol Hill...
I wouldn't think you'd be particularly
comfortable in this company.
Well, I'm not.
And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms Romanoff.
Why? You don't approve of all this?
The Accords, yes.
The politics, not really.
Two people in a room can get
more done than a hundred.
Unless you need to move a piano.
Ms Romanoff.
King T'Chaka.
Please, allow me to apologise
for what happened in Nigeria.
Thank you.
Thank you for agreeing to all of this.
I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers
will not be joining us today.
Yes, so am I.
If everyone could please be seated.
This assembly is now in session.
That is the future calling.
Such a pleasure.
Thank you.
For a man who disapproves of diplomacy,
you're getting quite good at it.
I'm happy, Father.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When stolen Wakandan vibranium
was used to make a terrible weapon...
we in Wakanda were forced
to question our legacy.
Those men and women killed in Nigeria...
were part of a goodwill mission
from a country too long in the shadows.
We will not, however,
let misfortune drive us back.
We will fight to improve
the world we wish to join.
I am grateful to the Avengers
for supporting this initiative.
Wakanda is proud
to extend its hand in peace.
Everybody get down!
My mom tried
to talk me out of enlisting...
but, um, not Aunt Peggy.
She bought me my first thigh holster.
Very practical.
And stylish.
CIA has you stationed over here now?
Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force.
Right. Right. Sounds fun.
I know, right?
I've been meaning to ask you.
When you were spying on me
from across the hall...
You mean when I was doing my job.
Did Peggy know?
She kept so many secrets.
I didn't want her to have one from you.
Thanks for walking me back.
Sure.
Steve.
There's something you gotta see.
A bomb hidden in a news van...
Who's coordinating?
...ripped through
the UN building in Vienna.
Good. They're solid. Forensics?
More than 70 people have been injured.
At least 12 are dead,
including Wakanda's King T'Chaka.
Officials have released
a video of a suspect...
who they have identified
as James Buchanan Barnes...
the Winter Soldier.
The infamous HYDRA agent...
linked to numerous acts of terrorism
and political assassinations.
I have to go to work.
Call MI6, see if we can get
Micro Forensics to hurry this up.
We need the whole team here
in two hours or it's not worth it.
I'm very sorry.
In my culture...
death is not the end.
It's more of a stepping-off point.
You reach out with both hands...
and Bast and Sekhmet,
they lead you into the green veldt...
where you can run forever.
That sounds very peaceful.
My father thought so.
I am not my father.
T'Challa...
Task Force will decide
who brings in Barnes.
Don't bother, Ms Romanoff.
I'll kill him myself.
Yeah?
You all right?
Uh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky.
I know how much Barnes
means to you. I really do.
Stay home. You'll only make this worse.
For all of us.
Please.
Are you saying you'll arrest me?
No.
Someone will.
If you interfere. That's how it works now.
If he's this far gone, Nat,
I should be the one to bring him in.
Why?
Because I'm the one
least likely to die trying.
Shit.
She tell you to stay out of it?
Might have a point.
He'd do it for me.
1945, maybe.
I just want to make sure
we consider all our options.
The people that shoot at you
usually wind up shooting at me.
Tips have been pouring in
since that footage went public.
Everybody thinks
the Winter Soldier goes to their gym.
Most of it's noise.
Except for this.
My boss expects a briefing,
pretty much now...
so that's all the head start
you're gonna get.
Thank you.
You're gonna have to hurry.
We have orders to shoot on sight.

I have your breakfast.
I could smell it before I opened the door.
Side of bacon and black coffee.
Again.
I can make you something
different, if you like.
This is wonderful...
I will just put this on your...
It's okay, I can manage!
Heads up, Cap.
German Special Forces,
approaching from the south.
Understood.
Do you know me?
You're Steve.
I read about you in a museum.
They've set the perimeter.
I know you're nervous,
and you have plenty of reason to be.
But you're lying.
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that any more.
They're entering the building.
Well, the people
who think you did are coming here now.
And they're not planning
on taking you alive.
That's smart.
Good strategy.
They're on the roof. I'm compromised.
This doesn't have to end in a fight, Buck.
- It always ends in a fight.
- Five seconds.
You pulled me from the river.
Why?
- I don't know.
- Three seconds.
Yes, you do.
Breach! Breach! Breach!
Buck, stop!
You're gonna kill someone.
I'm not gonna kill anyone.
Suspect has broken containment!
...he's headed down the east stairwell!
Come on, man.
Ahhh!
Sam, southwest rooftop.
Who the hell's the other guy?
About to find out.
- Sam.
- Got him.
Stand down!
Stand down!
Sam, I can't shake this guy.
Right behind you.
Stand down, now.
Congratulations, Cap.
You're a criminal.
Your Highness.
"A pinch of paprika."
A pinch.
Is that paprikash?
I thought it might lift your spirits.
Spirits lifted.
In my defence, I haven't actually
ever eaten anything before, so...
May I?
Please.
- Wanda?
- Hmm.
No one dislikes you, Wanda.
Thanks.
Oh, you're welcome.
No, it's a involuntary response
in their amygdala.
They can't help but be afraid of you.
Are you?
My amygdala is synthetic, so...
I used to think of myself one way.
But after this...
I am something else.
I'm still me, I think, but...
that's not what everyone else sees.
Do you know, I don't know what this is?
Not really.
I know it's not of this world...
that it powered Loki's staff,
gave you your abilities, but...
its true nature is a mystery.
And yet, it is part of me.
Are you afraid of it?
I wish to understand it.
The more I do, the less it controls me.
One day... who knows?
I may even control it.
I don't know what's in this
but it is not paprika.
I'm gonna go to the store.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Alternatively, we could order a pizza?
Vision, are you not letting me leave?
It is a question of safety.
I can protect myself.
Not yours.
Mr Stark would like to avoid
the possibility of another public incident.
Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.
And what do you want?
For people to see you...
as I do.
So, you like cats?
- Sam.
- What?
Dude shows up dressed like a cat,
you don't wanna know more?
Your suit... it's vibranium?
The Black Panther has been the protector
of Wakanda for generations.
A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior.
And now, because your friend
murdered my father...
I also wear the mantle of king.
So, I ask you...
as both warrior and king...
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?
What's gonna happen to him?
Same thing that ought to happen to you.
Psychological evaluation and extradition.
This is Everett Ross,
Deputy Task Force Commander.
What about a lawyer?
Lawyer. That's funny.
See their weapons are placed in lockup.
We'll write you a receipt.
I better not look out the window
and see anybody flying around in that.
You'll be provided
with an office instead of a cell.
Now, do me a favour, stay in it?
I don't intend on going anywhere.
For the record, this is what
making things worse looks like.
He's alive.
No.
Romania was not Accords-sanctioned.
Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.
Try not to break anything
while we fix this.
Consequences? You bet
there'll be consequences.
Obviously you can quote me on that,
because I just said it. Anything else?
Thank you, sir.
"Consequences"?
Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted.
Had to give him something.
I'm not getting that shield back, am I?
Technically, it's the
government's property.
Wings, too.
That's cold.
Warmer than jail.
Hey, you wanna see something cool?
I pulled something from Dad's archives.
Felt timely.
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.
Provided support to the Allies
when they needed it most.
Some would say it brought
our country closer to war.
See? If not for these,
you wouldn't be here.
I'm trying to... What do you call it?
That's an olive branch.
Is that what you call it?
Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.
We're kinda...
- Well, not kinda...
- Pregnant?
No. Definitely not.
We're taking a break.
It's nobody's fault.
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...
and then Ultron. My fault.
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.
Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.
I don't wanna lose her.
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.
In her defence, I'm a handful.
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,
but he and Mom always made it work.
I'm glad Howard got married.
I only knew him
when he was young and single.
Oh, really? You two knew each other?
He never mentioned that.
Maybe only a thousand times.
God, I hated you.
I don't mean to make things difficult.
I know, because you're
a very polite person.
If I see a situation pointed south...
I can't ignore it.
Sometimes I wish I could.
No, you don't.
No, I don't.
Sometimes...
Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your perfect teeth.
But I don't wanna see you gone.
We need you, Cap.
So far, nothing's happened
that can't be undone, if you sign.
We can make the last 24 hours legit.
Barnes gets transferred to
an American psych-centre...
instead of a Wakandan prison.
I'm not saying it's impossible...
but there would have to be safeguards.
Sure.
Once we put out the PR fire,
those documents can be amended.
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...
Wanda? What about Wanda?
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.
Vision's keeping her company.
Oh, God, Tony.
Every time I think you see
things the right way...
It's 100 acres with a lap pool.
It's got a screening room.
There's worse ways to protect people.
Protection?
Is that how you see this?
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.
- She's not a US citizen.
- Oh, come on, Tony.
And they don't grant visas
to weapons of mass destruction.
She's a kid!
Give me a break!
I'm doing what has to be done.
To stave off something worse.
You keep telling yourself that.
Hate to break up the set.
Hello, Mr Barnes.
I've been sent by
the United Nations to evaluate you.
Do you mind if I sit?
Your first name is James?
The receipt for your gear.
"Bird costume"? Come on.
I didn't write it.
I'm not here to judge you.
I just want to ask you a few questions.
Do you know where you are, James?
I can't help you if you
don't talk to me, James.
My name is Bucky.
Hello?
Hey!
Why would the Task Force
release this photo to begin with?
Get the word out,
involve as many eyes as we can?
Right. It's a good way
to flush a guy out of hiding.
Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.
Get seven billion people looking
for the Winter Soldier.
You're saying someone
framed him to find him?
Steve, we looked for the guy
for two years and found nothing.
We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.
Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee
that whoever framed him would get him.
It guarantees that we would.
Yeah.
Tell me, Bucky.
You've seen a great deal, haven't you?
I don't wanna talk about it.
You fear that if you open your mouth,
the horrors might never stop.
Don't worry.
We only have to talk about one.
Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes.
Friday, get me a source on that outage.
Sub-level five, East Wing.
What the hell is this?
Why don't we discuss your home?
Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no.
I mean your real home.

Mission report. December 16, 1991.
Help me.
Help.
Get up.
Who are you? What do you want?
To see an empire fall.
Hey.
Evac all civilians.
Get me a perimeter around the building,
and gunships in the air.
Please tell me you brought a suit.
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford,
three-piece, two-button.
I'm an active-duty non-combatant.
Follow me.
We're in position.
You could at least recognise me.
Damn it.
He asked me again
if you were going to be there.
I said I wasn't sure.
You should have seen his
little face. Just try, okay?
I'm going to bed.
I love you.
James Barnes the suspect
in the UN Vienna bombing...
...escaped custody today.
...also missing Avenger
Captain Steve Rogers...
and Sam Wilson.
Hey, Cap!
Steve.
Which Bucky am I talking to?
Your mom's name was Sarah.
You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.
Can't read that in a museum.
Just like that, we're supposed to be cool?
What did I do?
Enough.
Oh, God, I knew this would happen.
Everything HYDRA
put inside me is still there.
All he had to do
was say the goddamn words.
- Who was he?
- I don't know.
People are dead. The bombing, the setup...
the doctor did all that just
to get 10 minutes with you.
I need you to do
better than "I don't know."
He wanted to know about Siberia.
Where I was kept.
He wanted to know exactly where.
Why would he need to know that?
Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.
It hurts!
Good work.
Get me out of here.
Who were they?
Their most elite death squad.
More kills than anyone in HYDRA history.
And that was before the serum.
They all turn out like you?
Worse.
The doctor, could he control them?
Enough.
Said he wanted to see an empire fall.
With these guys, he could do it.
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight...
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilise.
They can take a whole country down
in one night, you'd never see them coming.
This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.
- If we call Tony...
- No, he won't believe us.
Even if he did...
Who knows if the Accords
would let him help.
We're on our own.
Maybe not.
I know a guy.
I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?
We will.
GSG 9's got the borders covered.
Recon's flying 24/7.
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.
It's clear you can't be objective.
I'm putting Special Ops on this.
What happens when the shooting starts?
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?
If we're provoked.
Barnes would've been eliminated
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.
There are dead people
who would be alive now.
Feel free to check my math.
All due respect, you're not gonna
solve this with boys and bullets, Ross.
You gotta let us bring them in.
How would that end
any differently than last time?
Because this time, I won't be
wearing loafers and a silk shirt.
72 hours, guaranteed.
36 hours.
Barnes.
Rogers.
Wilson.
Thank you, sir.
My left arm is numb. Is that normal?
You all right?
Always.
36 hours. Jeez.
We're seriously understaffed.
Oh, yeah.
It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now. Any shot?
You really think he'd be on our side?
No.
I have an idea.
Me, too. Where's yours?
Downstairs.
Where's yours?
Hey, May.
Mmm. Hey.
How was school today?
It was okay.
This crazy car parked outside.
- Oh, Mr Parker.
- Um...
What are you doing...
Hey! Uh, I'm Peter.
Tony.
What are you doing here?
It's about time we met.
You've been getting my emails, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?
Regarding the...
You didn't even tell me about the grant.
- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.
- Right.
- Yeah.
Remember when you applied?
Yeah.
I approved, so now we're in business.
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?
You keeping secrets from me now?
I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...
Anyway, what did I apply for?
That's what I'm here to hash out.
Okay. Hash it out, okay.
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.
Yeah, well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
- Let me just stop you there.
- Yeah.
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?
Yeah, it's pretty well funded.
Yeah? Wow.
Look who you're talking to.
- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.
As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad.
Whoa, what have we here? Retro tech, huh?
Thrift store? Salvation Army?
- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver?
Yeah, I was...
Anyway, look, um, I definitely
did not apply for your grant...
- Ah-ah! Me first.
- Okay.
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.
That's you, right?
Um, no.
- What do you mean?
- Yeah.
Look at you go.
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.
That's not easy. You got mad skills.
That's all on YouTube, though, right?
That's where you found that?
Because you know that's all fake.
It's all done on the computer.
Mmm-hmm.
It's like that video. What is it?
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?
Exactly.
Oh, what have we here?
Uh...
You're the Spider-ling.
Crime-fighting spider. You're Spider-Boy?
Spider-Man.
Not in that onesie, you're not.
It's not a onesie.
I don't believe this. I was actually
having a really good day today, Mr Stark.
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...
and Algebra test, nailed it.
Who else knows? Anybody?
Nobody.
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?
No. No.
No! If she knew, she would freak out.
And when she freaks out, I freak out.
You know what I think is really cool?
This webbing.
That tensile strength is off the charts.
Who manufactured that?
I did.
Climbing walls, how you doing that?
Adhesive gloves?
It's a long story. I was...
Lordy! Can you even see in these?
Yes, I can.
I'm blind!
I can see in those.
Okay?
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...
it's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.
There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.
You're in dire need of an upgrade.
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.
That's why I'm here.
Why you doing this?
I gotta know, what's your MO?
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?
Because...
Because I've been me my whole life,
and I've had these powers for six months.
Mmm-hmm.
I read books, I build computers.
Yeah, I would love to play football,
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.
Sure, because you're different.
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...
and then the bad things happen...
they happen because of you.
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?
Make the world
a better place, all that, right?
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.
That's what it is.
I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.
You got a passport?
No, I don't even have a driver's licence.
- You ever been to Germany?
- No.
Oh, you'll love it.
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?
I got homework.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.
Might be a little dangerous.
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.
Don't tell Aunt May.
All right, Spider-Man.
Get me out of this.
Sorry. I'll get the...
What is it?
Stay here, please.
Guess I shoulda knocked.
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?
Disappointing my kids.
I'm supposed to go waterskiing.
Cap needs our help. Come on.
Clint!
You should not be here.
Really?
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.
Please consider
the consequences of your actions.
Okay, they're considered.
Okay, we gotta go.
It's this way.
I've caused enough problems.
You gotta help me, Wanda.
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.
Shit.
I knew I should've stretched.
Clint, you can't overpower me.
I know I can't.
But she can.
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.
I'm leaving.
I can't let you.
I'm sorry.
If you do this...
they will never stop being afraid of you.
I can't control their fear, only my own.
Oh...
Come on. We got one more stop.
It's just a matter of time.
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,
and behavioural pattern scans.
Move or you will be moved.
As entertaining as that would be...
You really think you can find him?
My resources are considerable.
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.
You know where they are.
I know someone who does.
Not sure you understand
the concept of a getaway car.
It's low profile.
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.
Can you move your seat up?
No.
I owe you again.
Keeping a list.
You know, he kinda tried to kill me.
Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.
They're going to come looking for you.
I know.
Thank you, Sharon.
That was...
Late.
Damn right.
I should go.
Okay.
Cap.
You know I wouldn't have called
if I had any other choice.
Hey, man, you're doing me a favour.
Besides, I owe a debt.
Thanks for having my back.
It was time to get off my ass.
How about our other recruit?
He's rarin' to go.
Had to put a little coffee in him...
but he should be good.
What time zone is this?
Come on. Come on.
- Captain America!
- Mr Lang.
It's an honour.
I'm shaking your hand too long.
Wow! This is awesome!
Captain America.
I know you, too. You're great!
Jeez.
Ah, look, I wanna say, I know
you know a lot of super people, so...
thinks for thanking of me.
- Hey, man!
- What's up, Tic Tac?
Uh, good to see you.
Look, what happened last time when I...
It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.
They tell you what we're up against?
Something about some psycho-assassins?
We're outside the law on this one.
So if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.
Yeah, well, what else is new?
We should get moving.
We got a chopper lined up.
They're evacuating the airport.
Stark.
Stark?
Suit up.
Wow, it's so weird how you run
into people at the airport.
- Don't you think that's weird?
- Definitely weird.
Hear me out, Tony.
That doctor, the psychiatrist,
he's behind all of this.
Captain.
Your Highness.
Anyway...
Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.
That was 24 hours ago.
Can you help a brother out?
You're after the wrong guy.
Your judgement is askew.
Your old war buddy killed
innocent people yesterday.
And there are five more
super soldiers just like him.
I can't let the doctor
find them first, Tony. I can't.
Steve...
you know what's about to happen.
Do you really wanna
punch your way out of this one?
All right, I've run out of patience.
Underoos!
- Nice job, kid.
- Thanks.
I could have stuck the landing
a little better, it's just...
New suit. It's nothing, Mr Stark.
It's perfect. Thank you.
Yeah, we don't really need
to start a conversation.
Okay. Cap. Captain.
Big fan. I'm Spider-Man.
Yeah, we'll talk about it later.
- Hey, everyone.
- Good job.
You've been busy.
And you've been a complete idiot.
Dragging in Clint...
"Rescuing" Wanda from a place she doesn't
even want to leave, a safe place.
I'm trying to keep...
I'm trying to keep you from
tearing the Avengers apart.
You did that when you signed.
All right, we're done.
You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna
come with us, now, because it's us...
or a squad of J-SOC guys...
with no compunction about being impolite.
Come on.
We found it.
Their Quinjet's in
hangar five, north runway.
All right, Lang.
Hey, guys, something...
Whoa. What the hell was that?
I believe this is yours, Captain America.
Oh, great.
All right, there's two
on the parking deck.
One of them's Maximoff,
I'm gonna grab her.
Rhodey, you wanna take Cap?
Got two in the terminal,
Wilson and Barnes.
Barnes is mine.
Hey, Mr Stark, what should I do?
What we discussed.
Keep your distance, web them up.
Okay, copy that.
Move, Captain.
I won't ask a second time.
Look, I really don't want to hurt you.
I wouldn't stress about it.
What the hell is that?
Everyone's got a gimmick now.
You have a metal arm?
That is awesome, dude.
You have the right to remain silent!
Sorry, Cap, this won't kill you...
but it ain't gonna tickle either.
Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
You locked me in my room.
Okay, first, that's an exaggeration.
Second, I did it to protect you.
- Hey, Clint.
- Hey, man.
Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you.
You got tired of shooting golf?
Well, I played 18, shot 18.
Just can't seem to miss.
First time for everything.
Made you look.
Multiple contusions detected.
Yeah, I detected that, too.
Oh, God!
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!
Ahh!
Those wings carbon fibre?
Is this stuff coming out of you?
That would explain
the rigidity-flexibility ratio,
which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.
I don't know if you've
been in a fight before...
but there's usually not this much talking.
All right, sorry. My bad.
Guys, look, I'd love to keep this up,
but I've only got one job here today...
and I gotta impress Mr Stark,
so, I'm really sorry.
You couldn't have done that earlier?
I hate you.
Great.
Hey, Cap, heads-up!
Throw it at this.
Now!
Oh, come on!
Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck.
Uh, sorry.
All right, now I'm pissed.
Is this part of the plan?
Well, my plan was go easy on them.
You wanna switch it up?
There's our ride.
Come on!
Captain Rogers...
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.
But for the collective good...
you must surrender now.
What do we do, Cap?
We fight.
This is gonna end well.
They're not stopping.
Neither are we.
We're still friends, right?
Depends on how hard you hit me.
You were pulling your punches.
I didn't kill your father.
Then why did you run?
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.
Look, kid, there's a lot going on here
that you don't understand.
Mr Stark said you'd say that. Wow.
He also said to go for your legs.
Ahh!
Clint, can you get him off me?
Buckled in?
Yeah. No, I'm good.
I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go!
Stark tell you anything else?
That you're wrong. You think you're right.
That makes you dangerous.
Guess he had a point.
You got heart, kid. Where you from?
Queens.
Brooklyn.
Friday?
We have some weapon systems offline.
What?
Oh, you're gonna have to
take this into the shop.
Who's speaking?
It's your conscience.
We don't talk a lot these days.
Friday?
Deploying fire suppression system.
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy!
Whoa!
We gotta go.
That guy's probably in Siberia by now.
We gotta draw out the flyers.
I'll take Vision, you get to the jet.
No, you get to the jet!
Both of you!
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.
As much as I hate to admit it...
if we're gonna win this one,
some of us might have to lose it.
This isn't the real fight, Steve.
All right, Sam. What's the play?
We need a diversion. Something big.
I got something kinda big.
But I can't hold it very long.
On my signal, run like hell.
And if I tear myself in half...
don't come back for me.
He's gonna tear himself in half?
You sure about this, Scott?
I do it all the time.
I mean, once. In a lab.
Then I passed out.
I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss.
Holy shit!
Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.
I guess that's the signal.
Way to go, Tic Tac!
Give me back my Rhodey.
I got him.
Okay, anybody on our side
hiding any shocking
and fantastic abilities
they'd like to disclose...
I'm open to suggestions.
You wanna get to them...
you gotta go through me.
Uh-huh.
We haven't met yet.
- I'm Clint.
- I don't care.
Whoa!
Ahhh!
Get off!
Something just flew in me!
You're not gonna stop.
You know I can't.
I'm gonna regret this.
Go.
Hey, guys, you ever see
that really old movie,
Empire Strikes Back?
Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?
I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him.
He's on the young side.
You know that part
where they're on the snow planet...
with the walking thingies?
Maybe the kid's onto something.
High now, Tony. Go high.
Yes!
That was awesome!
Does anyone have any orange slices?
Kid, you all right?
Whoa!
Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
- Hey, man.
- Yeah.
- That was scary.
- Yeah.
You're done, all right?
What? I'm good, I'm fine.
You did a good job. Stay down.
No, it's good. I gotta get him back.
You're going home or I'll call Aunt May!
- Dude.
- You're done!
Wait.
Mr Stark, wait. I'm not done. I'm not...
Okay, I'm done. I'm done.
I said I'd help you find him,
not catch him.
There's a difference.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
It's as I said.
Catastrophe.
Vision, I got a bandit on my six.
Vision! You copy?
Target his thruster,
turn him into a glider.
Rhodey!
Tony, I'm flying dead stick.
Rhodes!
Read vitals.
Heartbeat detected.
Emergency medical is on its way.
I'm sorry.
- this is room 201...
Bacon and black coffee again today?
You know me so well...
Hello? Your breakfast is here.
May I let myself in?
What's gonna happen to your friends?
Whatever it is...
I'll deal with it.
I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.
What you did all those years...
It wasn't you.
You didn't have a choice.
I know.
But I did it.
How did this happen?
I became distracted.
I didn't think that was possible.
Neither did I.
The doctors say he shattered
L4 through S1.
Extreme laceration to the spinal cord.
Probably looking at
some form of paralysis.
Steve's not gonna stop.
If you don't either, Rhodey's
gonna be the best case scenario.
You let them go, Nat.
We played this wrong.
"We"?
Boy, it must be hard to shake
the whole double agent thing, huh?
It sticks in the DNA.
Are you incapable
of letting go of your ego...
for one goddamn second?
T'Challa told Ross what you did, so...
they're coming for you.
I'm not the one that needs
to watch their back.
What am I looking at, Friday?
Priority upload from Berlin police.
Fire up the chopper.
The Task Force called for a psychiatrist
as soon as Barnes was captured.
The UN dispatched Doctor Theo Broussard
from Geneva within the hour.
He was met by this man.
Did you run facial recognition yet?
What do I look like?
Uh, I don't know.
I've been picturing a redhead.
You must be thinking of someone else.
Must be.
The fake doctor is actually
Colonel Helmut Zemo.
Sokovian Intelligence.
Zemo ran Echo Scorpion...
a Sokovian covert kill squad.
What happened to the real Broussard?
He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room.
Where police also found
a wig and facial prosthesis...
approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.
Son of a bitch.
- Get this to Ross.
- Yes, boss.
This is Raft Prison Control.
You're cleared for landing, Mr Stark.
So? You got the files?
Let's reroute the satellites,
start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.
You seriously think I'm gonna listen
to you after that fiasco in Leipzig?
You're lucky you're not
in one of these cells.
The Futurist, gentlemen!
The Futurist is here!
He sees all!
He knows what's best for you,
whether you like it or not.
Give me a break, Barton.
I had no idea
they'd put you here. Come on.
Yeah, well, you knew
they'd put us somewhere, Tony.
Yeah, but not some
super-max floating ocean pokey.
This place is for maniacs.
This is a place for...
Criminals?
Criminals, Tony.
Think that's the word you're looking for.
Right?
That didn't used to mean me.
Or Sam, or Wanda.
But here we are.
- Because you broke the law.
- Yeah.
I didn't make you.
- La, la, la, la, la...
- You read it, you broke it.
You're all grown up,
you got a wife and kids.
I don't understand, why didn't you
think about them before
you chose the wrong side?
You gotta watch your back with this guy.
There's a chance he's gonna break it.
Hank Pym always said
you never can trust a Stark.
Who are you?
Come on, man.
How's Rhodes?
They're flying him to
Columbia Medical tomorrow...
so fingers crossed.
What do you need? They feed you yet?
You're the good cop, now?
I'm just the guy who needs
to know where Steve went.
Well, you better go get a bad cop...
because you're gonna have to
go Mark Fuhrman on my ass...
to get information out of me.
Well, I just knocked
the A out of their AV.
We got about 30 seconds before
they realise it's not their equipment.
What'd you do?
Get it back up!
Just look.
Because that...
is the fellow who was
supposed to interrogate Barnes.
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong.
That's a first.
Cap is definitely off the reservation...
but he's about to need
all the help he can get.
We don't know each other very well.
You don't have to...
Hey, it's all right.
Look, I'll tell you...
but you have to go alone and as a friend.
Easy.
Stark?
Did he give you anything on Rogers?
Nope. Told me to go to hell.
I'm going back to the compound instead,
but you can call me anytime.
I'll put you on hold.
I like to watch the line blink.
You remember that time we had to ride back
from Rockaway Beach
in the back of that freezer truck?
Was that the time we used our train money
to buy hot dogs?
You blew three bucks trying to win
that stuffed bear for a redhead.
What was her name, again?
Dolores. You called her Dot.
She's gotta be
a hundred years old right now.
So are we, pal.
He can't have been here
more than a few hours.
Long enough to wake them up.
You ready?
Yeah.
You seem a little defensive.
It's been a long day.
At ease, Soldier.
I'm not currently after you.
Then why are you here?
Could be your story's not so crazy.
Maybe.
Ross has no idea I'm here.
I'd like to keep it that way.
Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.
Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.
It's good to see you, Tony.
You too, Cap.
Hey, Manchurian Candidate,
you're killing me.
There's a truce here. You can drop...
I got heat signatures.
How many?
Uh, one.
If it's any comfort,
they died in their sleep.
Did you really think I wanted more of you?
What the hell?
I'm grateful to them, though.
They brought you here.
Please, Captain.
The Soviets built
this chamber to withstand
the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.
I'm betting I could beat that.
Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr Stark.
Given time.
But then you'd never know why you came.
You killed innocent people in Vienna
just to bring us here?
I've thought about
nothing else for over a year.
I studied you.
I followed you.
But now that you're standing here...
I just realised...
there's a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.
How nice to find a flaw.
You're Sokovian.
Is that what this is about?
Sokovia was a failed state
long before you blew it to hell.
No.
I'm here because I made a promise.
You lost someone?
I lost everyone.
And so will you.
An empire toppled
by its enemies can rise again.
But one which crumbles from within?
That's dead.
Forever.
I know that road.
What is this?
Help my wife.
Please. Help.
Sergeant Barnes?
Howard!
Howard!
No, Tony.
Did you know?
I didn't know it was him.
Don't bullshit me, Rogers. Did you know?
Yes.
Get out of here!
It wasn't him, Tony.
HYDRA had control of his mind!
Move!
It wasn't him!
Left bootjet failing.
Flight systems compromised.
Ah, crap.
He's not gonna stop. Go.
Come on, come on.
Targeting system's knackered, boss.
I'm eyeballing it.
Do you even remember them?
I remember all of them.
This isn't gonna change what happened.
I don't care.
He killed my mom.
You should have seen his little face.
Just try, okay?
I'm going to bed.
I love you.
I almost killed the wrong man.
Hardly an innocent one.
This is all you wanted?
To see them rip each other apart.
My father lived outside the city.
I thought we would be safe there.
My son was excited.
He could see the Iron Man
from the car window.
I told my wife, "Don't worry.
"They're fighting in the city.
We're miles from harm."
When the dust cleared...
and the screaming stopped...
it took me two days
until I found their bodies.
My father...
still holding my wife and son in his arms.
And the Avengers?
They went home.
I knew I couldn't kill them.
More powerful men than me have tried.
But, if I could get them
to kill each other...
I'm sorry about your father.
He seemed a good man.
With a dutiful son.
Vengeance has consumed you.
It's consuming them.
I am done letting it consume me.
Justice will come soon enough.
Tell that to the dead.
The living are not done with you, yet.
You can't beat him hand-to-hand.
Analyse his fight pattern.
Scanning.
Countermeasures ready.
Let's kick his ass.
He's my friend.
So was I.
Stay down. Final warning.
I could do this all day.
That shield doesn't belong to you.
You don't deserve it.
My father made that shield!
Meals at 8 and 5.
Toilet privileges twice a day.
Raise your voice, zap.
Touch the glass, zap.
You step out of line, you deal with me.
Please, step out of line, hmm?
So how does it feel?
To spend all that time, all that effort...
to see it fail so spectacularly?
Did it?
- It's just the first pass.
- Yeah.
Give me some feedback,
anything you think of.
Shock absorption, lateral movement.
Cup holder?
You may wanna think about
some AC down in...
Ow.
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
No. Don't help me.
Ah.
138 combat missions.
That's how many I've flown, Tony.
Every one of them
could've been my last, but I flew them.
Because the fight needed to be fought.
It's the same with these Accords.
I signed because it was
the right thing to do.
And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh...
This is a bad beat.
But it hasn't changed my mind.
I don't think.
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.
Are you Tony Stank?
Yes, this is Tony Stank.
You're in the right place.
Thank you for that!
Never dropping that, by the way.
"Table for one, Mr Stank.
"Please, by the bathroom."
Tony...
I'm glad you're back at the compound.
I don't like the idea of you
rattling around a mansion by yourself.
We all need family.
The Avengers are yours.
Maybe more so than mine.
I've been on my own since I was 18.
I never really fit in anywhere,
even in the Army.
My faith's in people, I guess.
Individuals.
And I'm happy to say that,
for the most part...
they haven't let me down.
Which is why I can't let them down either.
Locks can be replaced,
but maybe they shouldn't.
I know I hurt you, Tony.
I guess I thought by not telling you
about your parents...
I was sparing you...
but I can see now that
I was really sparing myself.
And I'm sorry.
Hopefully one day you can understand.
I wish we agreed on the Accords.
I really do.
I know you're doing what you believe in,
and that's all any of us can do.
That's all any of us should.
Priority call from Secretary Ross.
There's been a breach at the Raft prison.
Yeah, put him through.
Tony, we have a problem.
- Uh, please hold.
- No, don't.
So no matter what...
I promise you...
if you need us...
if you need me...
I'll be there.
You sure about this?
I can't trust my own mind.
So, until they figure out
how to get this stuff out of my head...
I think going back under
is the best thing.
For everybody.
Thank you for this.
Your friend and my father...
they were both victims.
If I can help one of them find peace...
You know, if they find out he's here...
they'll come for him.
Let them try.
Hey, shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe
And flower
You're the chosen one
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
I tackle, we tussle
Oh, my days, we're rolling
My right hand's gripped on his
Colt Single Action Army
Oh, no
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
N-E-O, O-M-G
Gee whiz
Girl, you're the one for me
Though your man's bigger than I am
Oh, my days
He disagrees
Oh, no
Speak easy
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Oh, no
Hey, shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe
And flower
You're the chosen one
Well, your left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Oh, no
Who was it? Who hit you?
Some guy.
So itchy, man, God.
What's "some guy's" name?
Uh, Steve.
Steve? From 12-C?
- With the overbite?
- No, no, no.
You don't know him. He's from Brooklyn.
Ouch.
Well...
I hope you got a few good licks in.
Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually.
His friend was huge. Like huge.
That's way better. Thank you.
Okay, tough guy.
Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door?
On your left.
On your left.
On my left. Got it.
Don't say it. Don't you say it.
- On your left.
- Come on!
Need a medic?
I need a new set of lungs.
Dude, you just ran, like,
13 miles in 30 minutes.
I guess I got a late start.
Really? You should
be ashamed of yourself.
You should take another lap.
Did you just take it?
I assume you just took it.
What unit you with?
58th Pararescue.
But now I'm working down at the VA.
- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.
I kind of put that together.
Must have freaked you out, coming
home after the whole defrosting thing.
It takes some getting used to.
It's good to meet you, Sam.
It's your bed, right?
What's that?
Your bed, it's too soft.
When I was over there,
I'd sleep on the ground,
use rock for pillows,
like a caveman.
Now I'm home, lying in my bed,
and it's like...
Lying on a marshmallow.
Feel like I'm gonna sink
right to the floor.
How long?
Two tours.
You must miss the
good old days, huh?
Well, things aren't so bad.
Food's a lot better.
We used to boil everything.
No polio is good.
Internet, so helpful.
I've been reading that a lot,
trying to catch up.
Marvin Gaye, 1972,
Trouble Man soundtrack.
Everything you missed
jammed into one album.
I'll put it on the list.
All right, Sam, duty calls.
Thanks for the run.
If that's what you
want to call running.
That's how it is?
- That's how it is.
- Okay.
Any time you want to stop by the VA,
make me look awesome
in front of the girl at the
front desk, just let me know.
- I'll keep it in mind.
- Yeah.
Hey, fellas.
Either one of you
know where the Smithsonian is?
I'm here to pick up a fossil.
That's hilarious.
- How you doing?
- Hey.
Can't run everywhere.
No, you can't.
Target is a mobile
satellite launch platform,
the Lemurian Star.
They were sending up their last
payload when pirates took them,
93 minutes ago.
- Any demands?
- Billion and a half.
- Why so steep?
- Because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.
So it's not off-course.
It's trespassing.
I'm sure they have a good reason.
You know, I'm getting a little
tired of being Fury's janitor.
Relax. It's not that complicated.
How many pirates?
25. Top mercs led by this guy.
Georges Batroc.
Ex-DGSE, Action Division.
He's at the top of
Interpol's Red Notice.
Before the French demobilized
him, he had 36 kill missions.
This guy's got a rep
for maximum casualties.
Hostages?
Mostly techs. One officer.
Jasper Sitwell.
They're in the galley.
What's Sitwell doing
on a launch ship?
All right, I'm gonna
sweep the deck and find Batroc.
Nat, you kill the engines
and wait for instructions.
Rumlow, you sweep aft,
find the hostages,
get them to the life-pods,
get them out. Let's move.
S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap.
Gear up.
Secure channel seven.
Seven secure.
Did you do anything fun
Saturday night?
Well, all the guys
from my barbershop quartet are dead,
so, no, not really.
Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.
You know, if you ask Kristen out,
from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.
That's why I don't ask.
Too shy, or too scared?
Too busy!
Was he wearing a parachute?
No.
No, he wasn't.
Hey!
Thanks.
Yeah. You seemed pretty
helpless without me.
What about the nurse that
lives across the hall from you?
She seems kind of nice.
Secure the engine room,
then find me a date.
I'm multi-tasking.
You want a bullet in your head?
Okay.
Hey, sailor.
Hey!
Targets acquired.
S.T.R.I.K.E. in position.
Natasha, what's your status?
Status, Natasha.
Hang on!
Engine room secure.
On my mark.
Three...
Two... One.
I told you, S.H.I.E.L.D.
doesn't negotiate.
Hostages en route to extraction.
Romanoff missed
the rendezvous point, Cap.
Hostiles are still in play.
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.
Circle back to Rumlow
and protect the hostages.
Natasha.
Well, this is awkward.
What are you doing?
Backing up the hard drive.
It's a good habit to get into.
Rumlow needed your help.
What the hell are you doing here?
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
Whatever I can get my hands on.
Our mission is to rescue hostages.
No, that's your mission,
and you've done it beautifully.
You just jeopardized
this whole operation.
I think that's overstating things.
Okay.
That one's on me.
You're damn right.
You just can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?
I didn't lie.
Agent Romanoff
had a different mission than yours.
Which you didn't feel
obliged to share.
I'm not obliged to do anything.
Those hostages could
have died, Nick.
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.
Not a bunch of guys
running around shooting guns.
Last time I trusted someone,
I lost an eye.
Look, I didn't want you doing
anything you weren't comfortable with.
Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.
I can't lead a mission
when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.
It's called compartmentalization.
Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.
Except you.
You're wrong about me.
I do share.
I'm nice like that.
- Insight bay.
- Captain Rogers does not have
clearance for Project Insight.
Director override.
Fury, Nicholas J.
Confirmed.
You know, they used to play music.
Yeah.
My grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years.
Granddad worked in a nice building.
Got good tips.
He'd walk home every night,
a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.
He'd say, "Hi."
People would say, "Hi" back.
Time went on,
the neighborhood got rougher.
He'd say, "Hi."
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."
Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.
Did he ever get mugged?
Every week some punk would say,
"What's in the bag?"
What would he do?
He'd show them.
Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.
Yeah, Granddad loved people.
But he didn't trust them very much.
Yeah, I know.
They're a little bit
bigger than a .22.
This is Project Insight.
Three next-generation helicarriers
synced to a network
of targeting satellites.
Launched from the Lemurian Star.
Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.
Continuous sub-orbital flight,
courtesy of our new repulsor engines.
Stark?
He had a few suggestions
once he got an up-close look
at our old turbines.
These new long-range precision guns
can eliminate 1,000
hostiles a minute.
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.
We're gonna neutralize a lot of
threats before they even happen.
Thought the punishment
usually came after the crime.
We can't afford to wait that long.
Who's "we"?
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.
For once, we're way
ahead of the curve.
By holding a gun to everyone on Earth
and calling it protection.
You know, I read those SSR files.
"Greatest Generation"?
You guys did some nasty stuff.
Yeah, we compromised.
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.
But we did it
so that people could be free.
This isn't freedom. This is fear.
S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as
it is, not as we'd like it to be.
And it's getting damn near past time
for you to get with that program, Cap.
Don't hold your breath.
Welcome to the Smithsonian.
Visitor information booths are
available on the second level.
A symbol to the nation.
A hero to the world.
The story of Captain America
is one of honor, bravery and sacrifice.
Denied enlistment
due to poor health,
Steven Rogers was chosen
for a program
unique in the annals
of American warfare.
One that would transform him
into the world's first Super-Soldier.
In this rare footage,
everyone's favorite war hero,
Captain America...
Battle tested,
Captain America
and his Howling Commandos
quickly earned their stripes.
Their mission:
taking down HYDRA,
the Nazi rogue science division.
Best friends since childhood,
Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers
were inseparable
on both schoolyard and battlefield.
Barnes is the only Howling
Commando to give his life
in service of his country.
That was a difficult winter.
A blizzard had trapped half
our battalion behind the German line.
Steve, Captain Rogers,
he fought his way
through a HYDRA blockade
that had pinned our allies
down for months.
He saved over 1,000 men.
Including the man who would...
Who would become my husband,
as it turned out.
Even after he died,
Steve was still changing my life.
You should be
proud of yourself, Peggy.
I have lived a life.
My only regret is that
you didn't get to live yours.
What is it?
For as long as I can remember,
I just wanted to do what was right.
I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is anymore.
And I thought I could throw
myself back in and follow orders.
Serve.
It's just not the same.
You're always so dramatic.
Look, you saved the world.
We rather mucked it up.
You didn't.
Knowing that you helped found
S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay.
Hey.
The world has changed,
and none of us can go back.
All we can do is our best.
And sometimes the best that
we can do is to start over.
Steve.
Yeah?
You're alive.
You came back.
Yeah, but...
It's been so long.
So long.
Well, I couldn't
leave my best girl.
Not when she owes me a dance.
Secure office.
Open Lemurian Star's
satellite launch file.
Access denied.
Run decryption.
Decryption failed.
Director override.
Fury, Nicholas J.
Override denied. AH files sealed.
On whose authority?
Fury, Nicholas J.
World Security Council.
Confirmed.
If Nick Fury thinks
he can get his costumed thugs
and S.T.R.I.K.E. commandos to
mop up his mess, he's sadly mistaken.
This failure is unacceptable.
Considering this attack took place
one mile from my country's
sovereign waters,
it's a bit more than that.
I move for immediate hearing.
We don't need hearings,
we need action.
It's this Council's duty
to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.
A breach like this
raises serious questions.
Like how the hell
did a French pirate
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D.
vessel in broad daylight?
For the record, Councilman,
he's Algerian.
I can draw a map if it'd help.
I appreciate your wit,
Secretary Pierce.
But this Council takes things like
international piracy fairly seriously.
Really? I don't.
I don't care about one boat,
I care about the fleet.
If this Council is going
to fall to rancor
every time someone pushes us
on the playing field,
maybe we need someone
to oversee US.
Mr. Secretary, nobody
is suggesting...
Excuse me.
More trouble, Mr. Secretary?
Depends on your definition.
I work 40 floors away and it takes
a hijacking for you to visit?
A nuclear war would do it, too.
You busy in there?
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.
I'm here to ask a favor.
I want you to call for a vote.
Project Insight has to be delayed.
Nick, that's not a favor,
that's a sub-committee hearing.
Along one.
It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.
I just need time
to make sure it's nothing.
But if it's something?
Then we'll both be damn glad
those helicarriers aren't in the air.
Fine.
But you got to get Iron Man
to stop by my niece's birthday party.
Thank you, sir.
And not just a flyby.
He's got to mingle.
The thing is,
I think it's getting worse.
A cop pulled me over last week.
He thought I was drunk.
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.
I thought it was an IED.
Some stuff you leave there.
Other stuff you bring back.
It's our job to figure
out how to carry it.
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase,
or in a little man-purse?
It's up to you.
- I'll see you next week.
- Definitely.
Look who it is, the running man.
Caught the last few minutes.
It's pretty intense.
Yeah, brother,
we all got the same problems.
Guilt,
regret.
You lose someone?
My wingman, Riley.
Flying a night mission.
Standard PJ rescue op.
Nothing we hadn't done
1,000 times before.
Until an RPG knocked Riley's
dumb ass out of the sky.
Nothing I could do.
It's like I was up
there just to watch.
- I'm sorry.
- After that,
I had a really hard time finding a reason
for being over there, you know?
But you're happy now,
back in the world?
The number of people giving me
orders is down to about zero.
So, hell yeah.
Are you thinking about getting out?
No.
I don't know.
To be honest, I don't know
what I would do with myself if I did.
Ultimate fighting?
Just a great idea off
the top of my head.
Seriously, you could do
whatever you want to do.
What makes you happy?
I don't know.
Activating communications
encryption protocol.
Open secure line 0405.
Confirmed.
This is Hill.
I need you here in D.C.
Deep shadow conditions.
Give me four hours.
You have three. Over.
Want to see my lease?
Fracture detected.
Recommend anesthetic injection.
D. C. Metro Police dispatch

Then reboot, damn it!

Get me off the grid!
Calculating route

So sweet. That is so nice.
Hi.
I got to go, though.
Okay. Bye.
My aunt, she's kind
of an insomniac.
Yeah.
Hey, if you want...
If you want,
you're welcome to use my machine.
Might be cheaper
than the one in the basement.
Yeah? What's it cost?
A cup of coffee?
Thank you, but
I already have a
load in downstairs,
and you really don't want
my scrubs in your machine.
I just finished a rotation
in the infectious disease ward, so...
Well, I'll keep my distance.
Hopefully, not too far.
And I think you left
your stereo on.
Right. Thank you.
Yeah.
I don't remember giving you a key.
You really think I'd need one?
My wife kicked me out.
I didn't know you were married.
A lot of things you
don't know about me.
I know, Nick. That's the problem.
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but I had no place else to crash.
Who else knows about your wife?
Just...
My friends.
Is that what we are?
That's up to you.
Don't trust anyone.
Captain Rogers?
Captain,
I'm Agent 13 of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Special Service.
Kate?
I'm assigned to protect you.
On whose order?
His.
Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive.
I need EMTs.
Do we have a 20 on the shooter?
Tell him I'm in pursuit.
Is he gonna make it?
I don't know.
Tell me about the shooter.
He's fast. Strong.
Had a metal arm.
Ballistics?
Three slugs, no rifling.
Completely untraceable.
Soviet-made.
Yeah.
He's in V-tach.
- Crash cart coming in.
- Nurse, help me with the drape.
- BP's dropping.
- Defibrillator!
I want you to charge him at 100.
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Stand back.
Three, two,
one. Clear.
- Pulse?
- No pulse.
Okay, 200, please.
Stand back!
Three, two, one. Clear!
Get me epinephrine!
Pulse?
Negative.
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me.
What's the time?
1:03, Doctor.
Time of death, 1:03 a.m.
I need to take him.
Natasha.
Natasha!
Why was Fury in your apartment?
I don't know.
Cap, they want you
back at S.H.I.E.L.D.
Yeah, give me a second.
They want you now.
Okay.
You're a terrible liar.
S.T.R.I.K.E. team,
escort Captain Rogers
back to S.H.I.E.L.D.
immediately for questioning.
I told him.
- Let's go.
- Yeah.
S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out.
Captain Rogers.
Neighbor.
Captain.
I'm Alexander Pierce.
Sir, it's an honor.
The honor's mine, Captain.
My father served in the 101st.
Come on in.
That photo was taken
five years after Nick and I met,
when I was at State Department
in Bogota.
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,
and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.
Nick was Deputy Chief
of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,
and he comes to me with a plan.
He wants to storm the building
through the sewers.
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?
They find it empty.
Nick had ignored my direct order,
and carried out an unauthorized
military operation on foreign soil,
and saved the lives of
a dozen political officers,
including my daughter.
So you gave him a promotion.
I've never had any
cause to regret it.
Captain, why was Nick
in your apartment last night?
I don't know.
Did you know it was bugged?
I did, because Nick told me.
Did he tell you
he was the one who bugged it?
I want you to see something.
Who hired you, Batroc?
Is that live?
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.
Are you saying he's a suspect?
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.
No, no. It's more
complicated than that.
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the Lemurian Star.
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,
and then the money was run
through 17 fictitious accounts.
The last one going to
a holding company
that was registered
to a Jacob Veech.
Am I supposed to know who that is?
Not likely. Veech
died six years ago.
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.
When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.
Are you saying
Fury hired the pirates? Why?
The prevailing theory
was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition
and sale of classified
intelligence.
The sale went sour
and that led to Nick's death.
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.
Why do you think we're talking?
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,
to build a really better world
sometimes means having
to tear the old one down.
And that makes enemies.
Those people that call you dirty
because you got the guts
to stick your hands in the mud
and try to build something better.
And the idea that those people
could be happy today
makes me really, really angry.
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.
I don't think that's an accident.
And I don't think you do, either.
So, I'm gonna ask again.
Why was he there?
He told me not to trust anyone.
I wonder if that included him.
I'm sorry.
Those were his last words.
Excuse me.
Captain,
somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.
Anyone gets in my way,
they're gonna regret it.
Anyone.
Understood.
Operations Control.
Confirmed.
Keep all S.T.R.I.K.E.
personnel on site.
- Understood.
- Yes, sir.
- Forensics.
- Confirmed.
Cap.
Rumlow.
Evidence Response found some fibers
on the roof they want us to see.
You want me to get
the tac team ready?
No, let's wait and see
what it is first.
Right.
What's the status so far?
- Administrations level.
- Confirmed.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry about
what happened with Fury.
It's messed up, what
happened to him.
Thank you.
Records.
Confirmed.
Before we get started,
does anyone want to get out?
Mobilize S.T.R.I.K.E.
units, 25th floor.
Whoa, big guy.-
I just want you to know, Cap,
this isn't personal!
It kind of feels personal.
Drop the shield
and put your hands in the air!
Give it up, Rogers!
Get that door open!
You have nowhere to go!
Are you kidding me?
He's headed for the garage.
Lock down the bridge.
Stand down, Captain Rogers.
Stand down.
Repeat, stand down.
Eyes here.
Whatever your op is, bury it.
This is Level One.
Contact DOT.
All traffic lights in
the district go red.
Shut all runways at BWI,
IAD and Reagan.
All security cameras in the city
go through this monitor right here.
Scan all open sources,
phones, computers,
PDAs. Whatever.
If someone tweets about this
guy, I want to know about it.
With all due respect,
if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting
a manhunt for Captain America
we deserve to know why.
Because he lied to us.
Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.
He refused to share it.
As difficult as this is to accept,
Captain America is a fugitive
from S.H.I.E.L.D.
- Where is it?
- Safe.
- Do better.
- Where did you get it?
Why would I tell you?
Fury gave it to you. Why?
- What's on it?
- I don't know.
Stop lying-
I only act like
I know everything, Rogers.
I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?
Well, it makes sense. The ship was
dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
I know who killed Fury.
Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.
The ones that do
call him the Winter Soldier.
He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations
in the last 50 years.
So he's a ghost story.
Five years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.
Somebody shot out
my tires near Odessa.
We lost control,
went straight over a cliff.
I pulled us out.
But the Winter Soldier was there.
I was covering my engineer
so he shot him
straight through me.
Soviet slug.
No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.
Yeah, I bet you look terrible
in them now.
Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.
Like you said, he's a ghost story.
Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.
Nick Fury was murdered
in cold blood.
To any reasonable person,
that would make him a martyr,
not a traitor.
You know what makes him a traitor?
Hiring a mercenary
to hijack his own ship.
Nick Fury used your friendship
to coerce this Council
into delaying Project Insight.
A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.
At best, he lied to you.
At worst...
Are you calling for my resignation?
I've got a pen and
paper right here.
That discussion can be tabled
for a later time.
But you do want to
have a discussion?
We've already had
it, Mr. Secretary.
This Council moves to
immediately reactivate Project Insight.
If you want to say something snappy,
now would be a good time.
First rule of going on the run
is don't run, walk.
If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.
The drive has a Level Six homing
program, so as soon as we boot up
S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.
How much time will we have?
About nine minutes from
now.
Fury was right about that ship.
Somebody's trying
to hide something.
This drive is protected
by some sort of AI.
It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.
Can you override it?
The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.
Slightly.
I'm gonna try running a tracer.
This is a program
that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed
to track hostile malware,
so if we can't read the file,
maybe we can find out
where it came from.
Can I help you guys with anything?
No. My fianc was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations.
Right. We're getting married.
Congratulations. Where are
you guys thinking about going?
New Jersey.
I have the exact same glasses.
Wow, you two are practically twins.
Yeah, I wish.
Specimen.
If you guys need anything,
I've been Aaron.
Thank you.
- You said nine minutes. Come on.
- Relax.
Got it.
You know it?
I used to. Let's go.
Standard tac team.
Two behind, two across,
and two coming straight at us.
If they make us, I'll engage,
you hit the south escalator to the metro.
Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.
- What?
- Do it.
Negative at the source.
Give me a floor rundown.
Negative on three.
Negative on two.
Snake the upper levels.
Work down to me.
- Kiss me.
- What?
Public displays of affection
make people very uncomfortable.
Yes, they do.
You still uncomfortable?
It's not exactly the
word I would use.
Where did Captain America
learn how to steal a car?
Nazi Germany.
And we're borrowing.
Take your feet off the dash.
All right, I have a question for you,
which you do not have to answer.
I feel like, if you
don't answer it though,
- you're kind of answering it, you know.
- What?
Was that your first
kiss since 1945?
- That bad, huh?
- I didn't say that.
Well, it kind of sounds like
that's what you're saying.
No, I didn't.
I just wondered
how much practice you've had.
- You don't need practice.
- Everybody needs practice.
It was not my first
kiss since 1945.
I'm 95, I'm not dead.
Nobody special, though?
Believe it or not,
it's kind of hard
to find someone with
shared life experience.
Well, that's all right.
You just make something up.
- What, like you?
- I don't know.
The truth is a matter
of circumstance.
It's not all things to all people,
all the time.
Neither am I.
That's a tough way to live.
It's a good way not to die, though.
You know, it's kind of hard
to trust someone,
when you don't know
who that someone really is.
Yeah.
Who do you want me to be?
How about a friend?
Well, there's a chance you might be
in the wrong business, Rogers.
This is it.
The file came from
these coordinates.
So did I.
This camp is where I was trained.
Change much?
A little.
Pick up the pace, ladies!
Let's go! Let's go!
Double time!
Come on, Rogers, move it!
Come on, fall in!
Rogers!
I said fall in!
This is a dead end.
Zero heat signatures,
zero waves, not even radio.
Whoever wrote the file must
have used a router to throw people off.
What is it?
Army regulations
forbid storing munitions
within 500 yards of the barracks.
This building is in
the wrong place.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.
Maybe where it started.
And there's Stark's father.
Howard.
Who's the girl?
If you're already working
in a secret office,
why do you need to
hide the elevator?
This can't be the data point.
This technology is ancient.
Y-E-S spells yes.
Shall we play a game?
- It's from a movie that was really...
- I know, I saw it.
Rogers, Steven,
born 1918.
Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna,
born 1984.
It's some kind of recording.
I am not a recording, Fraulein.
I may not be the man I was
when the Captain took
me prisoner in 1945.
But I am.
You know this thing?
You know this thing?
Arnim Zola was a German scientist
who worked for the Red Skull.
He's been dead for years.
First correction, I am Swiss.
Second, look around you.
I have never been more alive.
In 1972, I received a
terminal diagnosis.
Science could not save my body.
My mind, however,
that was worth saving,
on 200,000 feet of databanks.
You are standing in my brain.
- How did you get here?
- Invited.
It was Operation Paperclip
after World War II.
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited German
scientists with strategic value.
They thought I could
help their cause.
I also helped my own.
HYDRA died With the Red Skull.
Cut off one head,
two more shall take its place.
Prove it.
Accessing archive.
HYDRA was founded on
the belief that humanity
could not be trusted
with its own freedom.
What we did not realize was
that if you try
to take that freedom, they resist.
The war taught us much.
Humanity needed to surrender
its freedom willingly.
After the war,
S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded,
and I was recruited.
The new HYDRA grew.
A beautiful parasite
inside S.H.I.E.L.D.
For 70 years,
HYDRA has been secretly
feeding crisis, reaping war,
and when history did not cooperate,
history was changed.
That's impossible. S.H.I.E.L.D.
would have stopped you.
Accidents will happen.
HYDRA created a world so chaotic
that humanity is finally ready
to sacrifice its freedom
to gain its security.
Once a purification process
is complete,
HYDRA'S new world order will arise.
We won, Captain.
Your death amounts to
the same as your life.
A zero sum.
As I was saying...
What's on this drive?
Project Insight requires insight.
So, I wrote an algorithm.
What kind of algorithm?
What does it do?
The answer to your question
is fascinating.
Unfortunately, you shall
be too dead to hear it.
Steve, we got a bogey.
Short range ballistic.
- 30 seconds tops.
- Who fired it?
S.H.I.E.L.D.
I am afraid
I have been stalling, Captain.
Admit it.
It's better this way.
We are, both of us,
out of time.
Call in the asset.
I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce.
You need anything before I leave?
No... It's fine, Renata,
you can go home.
Okay. Night-night.
Good night.
Want some milk?
The timetable has moved.
Our window is limited.
Two targets, Level Six.
They already cost me Zola.
I want confirmed death in 10 hours.
Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...
I forgot my
phone.
Renata, I wish you
would have knocked.
Hey, man.
I'm sorry about this.
We need a place to lay low.
Everyone we know is
trying to kill us.
Not everyone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
What's going on?
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.
But I guess I just traded in
the KGB for HYDRA.
I thought I knew whose
lies I was telling,
but I guess I can't tell
the difference anymore.
There's a chance you might be
in the wrong business.
I owe you.
It's okay.
If it was the other way around,
and it was down to me
to save your life,
now you be honest with me,
would you trust me to do it?
I would now.
And I'm always honest.
Well, you seem pretty chipper
for someone who just found out
they died for nothing.
Well, guess I just like to
know who I'm fighting.
I made breakfast.
If you guys eat that sort of thing.
So, the question is,
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?
Pierce.
Who happens to be sitting on top
of the most secure building in the world.
But he's not working alone.
Zola's algorithm
was on the Lemurian Star.
So was Jasper Sitwell.
So, the real question is,
how do the two most wanted people
in Washington kidnap
a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight?
The answer is, you don't.
- What's this?
- Call it a rsum.
Is this Bakhmala?
The Khalid Khandil mission,
that was you?
You didn't say he was a Pararescue.
- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.
I heard they couldn't bring in the
choppers because of the RPGs.
What did you use? A stealth chute?
No.
These.
I thought you said
you were a pilot.
I never said pilot.
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.
You got out for a good reason.
Dude, Captain America
needs my help.
There's no better
reason to get back in.
Where can we get our hands on
one of these things?
The last one is at Fort Meade.
Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.
Shouldn't be a problem.
Listen, I got to fly home tonight
because I got some
constituency problem
and I got to press the flesh.
Any constituent in particular,
Mr. Senator?
No, not really.
Twenty-three, kind of hot.
Real hot, you know?
Wants to be a reporter, I think.
I don't know.
Who listens at that point?
Doesn't sound like
much of a problem to me.
Really? Because she's
killing my back.
But this isn't the place
to talk about it.
This is a nice pin.
- Thank you.
- Come here.
Hail HYDRA.
- See, it's right there...
- Yeah, I just saw that.
- Should I get it checked?
- I think you should.
I need a minute.
Bring the car around.
Yes, sir?
Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?
I hear the crab cakes here
are delicious.
Who is this?
The good-looking guy in the
sunglasses, your 10 o' clock.
Your other 10 o'clock.
There you go.
What do you want?
You're gonna go around
the corner to your right.
There's a gray car two spaces down.
You and I are gonna take a ride.
And why would I do that?
Because that tie looks
really expensive,
and I'd hate to mess it up.
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.
Never heard of it.
What were you doing
on the Lemurian Star?
I was throwing up. I get seasick.
Is this little display meant to insinuate
that you're gonna throw me off the roof?
Because it's really not
your style, Rogers.
You're right.
It's not.
It's hers.
Wait. What about that girl
from Accounting, Laura...
Lillian. Lip piercing, right?
Yeah, she's cute.
Yeah. I'm not ready for that.
Zola's algorithm is a program
for choosing
- insight's targets.
- What targets?
You!
A TV anchor in Cairo,
the Under Secretary of Defense,
a high school Valedictorian
in Iowa City,
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange,
anyone who's a threat
to HYDRA.
Now, or in the future.
In the future? How could it know?
How could it not?
The 21st century is a digital book.
Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.
Your bank records,
medical histories, voting patterns,
emails, phone calls,
your damn SAT scores!
Zola's algorithm
evaluates people's past
to predict their future.
And what then?
Oh, my God. Pierce
is gonna kill me.
What then?
Then the Insight helicarriers
scratch people off the list.
A few million at a time.
HYDRA doesn't like leaks.
Then why don't you try
sticking a cork in it?
Insight's launching in 16 hours.
We're cutting it a
little bit close here.
I know. We'll use him
to bypass the DNA scans
and access the
helicarriers directly.
What? Are you crazy?
That is a terrible, terrible idea.
Shit!
Hang on!
Go! I got this!
Taking fire above
and below expressway.
Civilians threatened.
Repeat, civilians threatened.
I make an LZ, 2300 block
of Virginia Avenue.
Rendezvous, two minutes.
Get out of the way!
Stay out of the way!
Bucky?
Who the hell is Bucky?
Drop the shield, Cap!
Get on your knees!
Get on your knees!
Get down, get down!
Get on your knees!
Down!
Don't move.
Put the gun down.
Not here. Not here!
It was him.
He looked right at me
like he didn't even know me.
How is that even possible?
It was, like, 70 years ago.
Zola.
Bucky's whole unit
was captured in '43.
Zola experimented on him.
Whatever he did
helped Bucky survive the fall.
They must have found him and...
None of that's your fault, Steve.
Even when I had
nothing, I had Bucky.
We need to get a doctor here.
If we don't put
pressure on that wound,
she's gonna bleed out
here in the truck.
That thing was squeezing my brain.
Who is this guy?
Three holes. Start digging.
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.
Maybe two.
- Let me take her.
- She'll want to see him first.
About damn time.
Lacerated spinal column,
cracked sternum,
shattered collarbone,
perforated liver,
and one hell of a headache.
Don't forget your collapsed lung.
Let's not forget that.
Otherwise, I'm good.
They cut you open.
Your heart stopped.
Tetrodotoxin B.
Slows the pulse to
one beat a minute.
Banner developed it for stress.
Didn't work so great for him,
but we found a use for it.
Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?
Any attempt on the Director's
life had to look successful.
Can't kill you if
you're already dead.
Besides,
I wasn't sure who to trust.
Sergeant Barnes.
Bucky, no!
The procedure has already started.
You are to be the
new fist of HYDRA.
Put him on ice.
Sir.
He's unstable.
Erratic.
Mission report.
Mission report now.
The man on the bridge.
Who was he?
You met him earlier this week
on another assignment.
I knew him.
Your work has been
a gift to mankind.
You shaped the century.
And I need you to do
it one more time.
Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.
And tomorrow morning,
we're gonna give it a push.
But, if you don't do your part,
I can't do mine.
And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.
But I knew him.
Prep him.
He's been out of cryo
freeze too long.
Then wipe him and start over.
This man declined
the Nobel Peace Prize.
He said peace wasn't
an achievement,
it was a responsibility.
See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.
We have to stop the launch.
I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls anymore.
What's that?
Once the helicarriers
reach 3,000 feet,
they'll triangulate with Insight satellites,
becoming fully weaponized.
We need to breach those carriers
and replace their targeting
blades with our own.
One or two won't cut it.
We need to link all three
carriers for this to work,
because if even one of those
ships remains operational,
a whole lot of people
are gonna die.
We have to assume everyone aboard
those carriers is HYDRA.
We have to get past them,
insert these server blades.
And maybe, just maybe
we can salvage what's left...
We're not salvaging anything.
We're not just
taking down the carriers, Nick.
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.
S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing
to do with this.
You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.
HYDRA grew right under your nose
and nobody noticed.
Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.
How many paid the price
before you did?
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.
Even if you had,
would you have told me?
Or would you have
compartmentalized that, too?
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA,
it all goes.
He's right.
Don't look at me.
I do what he does, just slower.
Well...
It looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.
We looked for you, after.
My folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery.
I know, I'm sorry.
I just kind of wanted to be alone.
How was it?
It was okay.
She's next to Dad.
I was gonna ask...
I know what you're gonna say, Buck.
I just...
We can put the
couch cushions on the floor
like when we were kids.
It'll be fun. All you got
to do is shine my shoes,
maybe take out the trash.
Come on.
Thank you, Buck,
but I can get by on my own.
The thing is, you don't have to.
I'm with you to the
end of the line, pal.
He's gonna be there, you know.
I know.
Look, whoever he used to be
and the guy he is now,
I don't think he's
the kind you save.
He's the kind you stop.
I don't know if I can do that.
Well, he might not
give you a choice.
He doesn't know you.
He will.
Gear up. It's time.
You gonna wear that?
No. If you're gonna fight a war,
you got to wear a uniform.
Oh, man.
I am so fired.
We are in final launch sequence.
We are go on guidance.
AH personnel to launch stations.
And how was your flight?
Lovely.
The ride from the airport, less so.
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't
control everything.
Including Captain America.
This facility is
biometrically controlled.
And these will give you
unrestricted access.
I've been parking
there for two months.
- But it's his spot.
- So where's he been?
I think Afghanistan.
Negative DT Six. The
pattern is full.
Well, he could've said something.
Must be the dish.
I'll check it out.
Triskelion command request
we clear the area for launch.
Excuse us.
I know the road
hasn't exactly been smooth,
and some of you would have gladly
kicked me out of the car along the way.
Finally, we're here.
And the world should be grateful.
Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,
this is Steve Rogers.
You've heard a lot about me
over the last few days.
Some of you were even ordered
to hunt me down.
But I think it's time
you know the truth.
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.
It's been taken over by HYDRA.
Alexander Pierce is their leader.
The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight crew
are HYDRA as well.
I don't know how many more,
but I know they're in the building.
They could be standing
right next to you.
They almost have what they want.
Absolute control.
They shot Nick Fury.
And it won't end there.
If you launch those
helicarriers today,
HYDRA will be able to kill
anyone that stands in their way.
Unless we stop them.
I know I'm asking a lot.
But the price of freedom is high.
It always has been.
And it's a price I'm
willing to pay.
And if I'm the only
one, then so be it.
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.
Did you write that down first,
or was it off the top of your head?
You smug son of a bitch.
Arrest him.
I guess I've got the floor.
Preempt the launch sequence.
Send those ships up now.
Is there a problem?
Is there a problem?
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not gonna launch those ships.
Captain's orders.
Move away from your station.
Like he said...
Hold it right there.
Put the gun down!
Captain's orders.
You picked the wrong side, Agent.
Depends on where you're standing.
Close the bay door!
Close the bay door now!
Close the bay door!
They're initiating launch.
Hey, Cap, how do we know
the good guys from the bad guys?
If they're shooting
at you, they're bad.
Hey, Cap,
I found those bad guys
you were talking about.
You okay?
I'm not dead yet.
Let me ask you a question.
What if Pakistan marched
into Mumbai tomorrow
and you knew that they were
going to drag your daughters
into a soccer stadium
for execution,
and you could just stop it,
with a flick of the switch.
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you all?
Not if it was your switch.
I'm sorry.
Did I step on your moment?
Satellites in range at 3,000 feet.
Falcon, status?
Engaging-
All right, Cap. I'm in.
Oh, shit.
Eight minutes, Cap.
Working on it.
What are you doing?
She's disabling security protocols
and dumping all the secrets
onto the Internet.
- Including HYDRA'S.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.
If you do this,
none of your past is
gonna remain hidden.
Are you sure you're ready
for the world to see you
as you really are?
Are you?
Alpha lock.
Falcon, where are you now?
I had to take a detour.
Oh, yeah!
I'm in.
Bravo lock.
Two down, one to go.
All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble.
We're the only air support
Captain Rogers has got.
Disabling the encryption
is an executive order.
It takes two Alpha Level members.
Don't worry. Company's coming.
Did you get my flowers?
- I'm glad you're here, Nick.
- Really?
Because I thought
you had me killed.
You know how the game works.
So why make me head
of S.H.I.E.L.D.?
Because you were the best,
and the most ruthless person
I ever met.
I did what I did to protect people.
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.
Disorder. War.
It's just a matter of time
before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,
or an EMF' fries Chicago.
Diplomacy?
A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.
And you know where
I learned that. Bogota.
You didn't ask.
You just did what had to be done.
I can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people
by sacrificing 20 million.
It's the next step, Nick.
If you have the courage to take it.
No. I have the courage not to.
Retinal scanner active.
You don't think we've wiped
your clearance from the system?
I know you erased my password.
Probably deleted my retinal scan.
But if you want to stay ahead
of me, Mr. Secretary,
you need to keep both eyes open.
Alpha level confirmed.
Encryption code accepted.
Safeguards removed.
Charlie carrier is 45
degrees off the port bow.
Six minutes.
Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride.
Roger. Let me know
when you're ready.
I just did!
You know, you're a lot heavier
than you look.
I had a big breakfast.
Steve!
Cap! Cap, come in. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm here.
I'm still on the helicarrier.
- Where are you?
- I'm grounded.
The suit's down. Sorry, Cap.
Don't worry. I got it.
Emergency evacuation alert.
All personnel, proceed to
designated safety zones.
All S.H.I.E.L.D. agents
regroup at Rally Point Delta.
Sir, the Council's been breached.
- Repeat, Dispatch.
- Black Widow's up there.
Headed up.
- Falcon?
- Yeah.
Rumlow's headed for the Council.
I'm on it.
People are gonna die, Buck.
I can't let that happen.
Please don't make me do this.
Done.
And it's trending.
Unless you want a two-inch
hole in your sternum,
I'd put that gun down.
That was armed the moment
you pinned it on.
Drop it!
Drop it!
I'm on 41, headed toward
the southwest stairwell.
This is gonna hurt.
There are no prisoners with HYDRA.
Just order.
And order only comes through pain.
- You ready for yours?
- Man, shut the hell up.
Lieutenant, how much longer?
65 seconds to satellite link.
Targeting grid engaged.
Lowering weapons array now.
One minute.
30 seconds, Cap.
Stand by.
Charlie...
We've reached 3,000 feet.
Sat link coming online now.
Deploy algorithm.
Algorithm deployed.
We are go to target.
Target saturation reached.
All targets assigned.
Fire when ready.
Firing in...
Three,
two...
One.
Charlie lock.
Where are the targets?
Where are the targets?
Okay, Cap, get out of there.
Fire now.
- But, Steve...
- Do it!
Do it now!
What a waste.
So, you still on the fence
about Rogers' chances?
Time to go, Councilwoman. This way.
Come on.
You're going to fly me out of here.
You know, there was a time
I would've taken a bullet for you.
You already did.
You will again, when it's useful.
Romanoff.
Natasha.
Natasha! Come on!
Those really do sting.
Hail HYDRA.
You're out of your depth, kid.
Son of a bitch!
Please tell me you got
that chopper in the air!
Sam, where are you?
41st floor! Northwest corner!
We're on it! Stay where you are!
Not an option!
41st floor! 41st!
It's not like they put the floor numbers
on the outside of the building.
Hill! Where's Steve?
You got a location on Rogers?
You know me.
No, I don't!
Bucky.
You've known me your whole life.
Your name is James Buchanan Barnes.
Shut up!
I'm not gonna fight you.
You're my friend.
You're my mission.
You're my mission!
Then finish it.
Because I'm with you
to the end of the line.
On your left.
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Why haven't we yet heard
from Captain Rogers?
I don't know what there is
left for him to say.
I think the wreck in
the middle of the Potomac
made his point fairly eloquently.
Well, he could explain how
this country is expected to maintain
its national security
now that he and you have laid waste
to our intelligence apparatus.
HYDRA was selling you lies,
not intelligence.
Many of which you seemed to have had
a personal hand in telling.
Agent, you should know
that there are some
on this committee
who feel, given your
service record,
both for this country
and against it,
that you belong in a penitentiary.
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.
You're not going to
put me in a prison.
You're not going to put any of us
in a prison. You know why?
Do enlighten us.
Because you need us.
Yes, the world is a
vulnerable place,
and yes, we help make it that way.
But we're also the ones
best qualified to defend it.
So, if you want to
arrest me, arrest me.
You'll know where to find me.
So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.
You get used to it.
We've been data
mining HYDRA'S files.
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.
I'm headed to Europe tonight.
Wanted to ask if you'd come.
There's something I
got to do first.
How about you, Wilson?
Could use a man with your abilities.
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.
All right, then.
Anybody asks for me, tell them
they can find me, right here.
You should be honored.
That's about as close as he gets
to saying thank you.
Not going with him?
No.
- Not staying here.
- Nah.
I blew all my covers.
I got to go figure out a new one.
That might take a while.
I'm counting on it.
That thing you asked for,
I called in a few favors from Kiev.
Will you do me a favor?
Call that nurse.
She's not a nurse.
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.
She's nice.
Be careful, Steve.
You might not want to
pull on that thread.
You're going after him.
You don't have to come with me.
I know.
When do we start?
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.
Everything he knows about.
Herr Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,
if they find out we serve HYDRA...
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.
Two sides of a coin
that's no longer currency.
What we have
is worth more than
any of them ever knew.
We've only scratched
the surface and already,
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA'S good work around the world.
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colorful friends,
and keep them off our scent.
What about the volunteers?
The dead will be buried so deep
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.
And the survivors?
The twins.
Sooner or later, they
will meet the twins.
It's not a world of spies anymore.
Not even a world of heroes.
This is the age of
miracles, Doctor.
There's nothing more horrifying
than a miracle.
Is it ready?
Hey! That's a great punch.
Fear no good.
So emotion and control.
Breathe. Breathe.
Wait.
Okay.
I can make it work for a while,
but you need...
Okay. Okay.
Shut that off! Turn it off!
Watch out!
Okay!
That's not right.
Oh, you.
You see that? See that?
My ticket out of here.
Damn it!
Here's something
a bit more interesting.
It's a possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.
A man drank one of those guarana sodas.
Guess it had a little more kick
than he was looking for.
Wow.
- Where was it bottled?
- Porto Verde, Brazil.
Have our people look for a white man
at the bottling plant.
Tell them no contact!
If he even sees them, he's gone!
I got you who I could.
Short notice, but they're all quality.
And I pulled you one ace.
Emil Blonsky.
Born in Russia, raised in England.
And on loan to SOCOM
from the Royal Marines.
I know you
cashed in some chips for this, Joe.
Glad I could help. Just make it good.
This is the target and the location.
Snatch and grab, live capture.
You'll have your dart clips
and suppression ordnance,
but live fire is for backup only.
We got local out there,
but we want it tight and quiet.
Is he a fighter?
Your target is a fugitive
from the US government
who stole military secrets.
He is also implicated
in the deaths of two scientists,
a military officer, an Idaho state trooper
and possibly two Canadian hunters.
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!
Tranq him and bring him back.
Oh, come on.
Camera.
Here we go.
Get rid of the damn dog.
Take him!
Target's on the move.
Where is he?
He's on the ground.
- Let's go!
- Go!
Move, move!
Go, go, go!
Go! Go!
Clear everyone out!
Do not lose him!
Oh! No!
Get around behind him!
Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.
Oh, no.
You got to be kidding me.
- Where is he?
- Target acquired.
Gringo!
Let's go.
No!
Please! No!
Not the computer!
Gimme that! No!
You bad angry, G?
I very bad angry.
Oh, no.
You don't understand! Something really bad
is about to happen here!
Anybody else seeing this?
We've got a bogey
of some kind. Please advice.
That is the target!
Use every tranq you've got!
Do it now!
Go live! Go live! Go live!
Move!
- Get out of the way!
No!
It's behind us! Move! Move!
Get him!
Shoot!
Leave me alone.
No! No!
I knew something was different
before I got the shot off.
He had it on him when he bolted.
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?
She is no longer a factor.
We closed that door to him a long time ago.
He's alone.
He wants to be alone.
But see if he's been talking to anybody.
Forgive me, sir?
Doesn't anybody want to talk
about what went down in there? 'Cause...
He didn't lose us.
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.
And then something hit us, something...
Something big hit us!
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!
It was the most powerful thing
I've ever seen.
Well, it's gone.
Well, if Banner knows what it is,
I'm gonna track him down,
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat
- and I'm gonna...
- That was Banner.
It
was Banner.
- You have to explain that statement, sir.
- No, I don't.
You've done a good job.
Pack up and get our men on a plane.
We're going home.
Wait.
Please.
Where am I?
I've run into bad situations
on crap missions before.
I've seen good men go down
purely because someone didn't let us know
what we were walking into.
I've moved on to the next one,
because that's what we do, right?
I mean, that's the job.
But this?
This is a whole new level of weird.
And I don't feel inclined
to step away from it.
So if you're taking another crack at him,
I want in.
And, with respect, you should be looking
for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,
because if that thing shows up again,
you're gonna have a lot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants.
Sir.
Tienes ms stretchy?
Yeah. Perfecto.
Let me emphasise
that what I'm about to share with you
is tremendously sensitive,
both to me personally and the Army.
You're aware that we've got an
Infantry Weapons Development programme.
Well, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.
Yeah, Super Soldier.
Yes.
An oversimplification, but yes.
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing
serious work again, bold work.
Across the hall,
they were trying to arm you better.
We were tryin' to make you better.
Banner's work was very early phase.
It wasn't even weapons application.
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.
I would never have told him
what the project really was.
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.
And something went very wrong.
Or it went very right.
As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is the property of the US Army.
You said he wasn't working
on weapons, right?
- No.
- But you were. You were, weren't you?
You were trying other things.
One serum we developed
was very promising.
- So why did he run?
- He's a scientist.
He is not one of us.
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45?
- 39.
- It takes a toll, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.
So get out of the trenches.
You should be a Colonel by now,
with your record.
No, I'm a fighter.
I'll be one for as long as I can.
You know, if I could take what I know now,
put it in the body I had ten years ago,
that would be someone
I wouldn't want to fight.
I could probably arrange
something like that.
Take care, kids.
Stan, I give you my word,
whatever you've heard about me,
it's not true.
Oh, I know it. I always knew it.
I mean, you know how I felt about you two.
- Have you talked to her?
- No.
She doesn't know that I'm here.
- She's with somebody?
- Yeah, he's a head shrink.
They say he's one of the best.
But a really nice guy.
Good. That's good.
- Bruce, what can I do to help you?
- I could use a bed for a few nights.
- You can have the spare room upstairs.
- That'd be so great.
There is one other thing.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Coming through.
Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.
I don't think there's anybody up there.
Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell
if I don't collect. You got to let me try.
I'll tell you what. I got an extra medium.
Take it on the house.
- You are the man.
- God bless you, brother.
All right.
Okay.
We're pretty well closed here, folks.
I'm sorry.
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.
Oh, kids.
I got nothing but marinara now.
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.
She worked through dinner again,
of course.
Stan?
And he... I go, "So, yeah,
I mean, where were you?
"I can't... I don't know
where you were, Cecil."
And he goes, "Not where you been at."
I thought, "Oh, my God." I just felt so awful.
Bruce?
Betty? What's going on?
Betty...
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.
- I don't know what to say.
- Please, just tell me the truth.
Don't go. Don't go.
I want you to come with me now.
Please. Come with me.
Please.
It's our data.
I got in there before they carted it all away.
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us
something someday.
- Does the General know that you have this?
- No, I don't think so.
I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.
You have to be sure.
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't
just go in there together and talk to him.
He told me what he wanted to do.
He wants it out of me.
He wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it.
He wants to make it a weapon.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I thought you might want to...
- Thanks.
Listen, I should leave early,
as early as I can.
Really? You can't stay at all?
I want to,
but it's just not safe for me to be here.
- If I could borrow some cash...
- Of course.
I need to take a bus.
Well, at least let me walk you to the station.
Okay.
- You have everything you need?
- Yeah.
I...
What?
- Good night.
- Good night.
I hope you get some rest.
We're giving you a very low dose only.
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.
First sign of any side effect,
we stop and you're off team
until you straighten out.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
You'll get two separate infusions.
One into the deep muscle,
one into the bone marrow centres.
The bone ones are going to hurt.
Is everything okay?
I think so.
Come here.
- I just wanna do this.
- Oh.
- It's better like that.
- Yeah?
It feels too tight, huh?
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.
- What?
- They're here.
- Betty, look at me, look at me!
- Bruce!
You have to go far away
from me as you can!
- Don't argue with me, just go. Go!
- Bruce!
Damn it! We'd have had snipers on target
in three more minutes.
I wanna know who jumped the gun.
He's heading 2-7-0.
Blonsky! Not yet!
Sir.
Look alive. This could get interesting.
I got him!
Stop! Stop!
I know you're in there!
General, please!
Sir?
Dad!
- Dad, please don't do this.
- You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.
There he is!
Target is in the overpass. We have a visual.
Do not engage! Repeat, do not engage!
He's locked in.
Put two canisters in there with him.
Fire!
Get her back here!
Now she'll see.
Alpha team?
Let him have all of it.
Come on, light him up!
Where are the fifty cals? Move your asses!
Oh, my God!
Blonsky, now you're up!
Sir?
Cover me.
Remember me?
My God, he's doing it.
Move him toward the cannons!
Move!
Hold your position!
Do it now!
Please, please, please, no!
- Please, please, please!
- Get her back!
You're killing him!
Stop! Get off of me!
Bruce!
Bruce! Bruce!
Where's the gunship?
Is that it?
Blonsky, pull back now.
Pull back!
Is that all you got?
- Fall back!
- Fall back! Let's go, let's go!
Find cover!
Betty!
Fire, goddamn it!
Bruce?
Stop firing!
No!
You did the right thing, calling us.
I need to know where they're going.
She'll be in incredible danger
as long as she's with him.
From who?
He protected her. You almost killed her.
I give you my word, her safety
is my main concern at this point.
You know, it's a point
of professional pride with me
that I can always tell
when somebody's lying.
And you are.
I don't know where he's going.
- I know she'll help him, if she can.
- Then she's aiding a fugitive.
And I can't help either one of them.
I used to wonder
why she never talked about you.
Now I know!
Where does she meet these guys?
Bruce?
Bruce.
It's okay. It's okay.
Come here. Come this way.
Watch your head.
Okay.
We're okay.
It's okay.
It's just the rain.
Will he ever walk again?
Most of the bones in his body
look like crushed gravel right now.
I will say this for him.
He's got a heart like a machine.
Never seen anything like it,
outside of a racehorse.
Here.
Okay.
Bruce?
Oh, hi.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better.
- Good.
- I just had to get my data back.
You ate it?
Well, you know, the circumstances
called for a little improvisation.
Wow.
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection,
but I got you some options.
First thing's first.
Oh, you're kidding me.
What?
- No.
- They were the stretchiest pair they had.
I'll take my chances.
Rumours continue
to swirl about a violent clash
between forces of the US military
and an unknown adversary
on the campus of Culver University
earlier today.
Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson
witnessed some of the battle.
It was so big.
- It was like this huge, like, hulk!
- Yeah.
McGhee, who happens
to be a reporter for the campus paper,
captured this on his cell phone.
Further search for the mysterious "hulk"
was postponed by powerful thunderstorms
in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.
Not too short back there.
I have done this before, you know.
I don't know how you've done this
on your own for all this time.
With clippers, usually.
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
- What? What?
We can't do this.
- It's okay. I want to.
- No.
No.
I can't.
I can't get too excited.
Not even a little excited?
It's okay.
Sir, it's Blonsky.
Has anyone found out
if he has next of kin or family?
Ask him yourself.
Sir?
- Good to see you back on your feet, soldier.
- Thank you, sir.
How do you feel?
Pissed off and ready for round three.
Basically, we can't use any of this,
because they can track all of it.
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?
- No. You can take your lip gloss.
- Thank you.
- Well, I need my glasses.
- Well, you can take
- your glasses and your watch, okay?
- Okay.
We can use most of it. We just can't use
the credit cards, the ID or the phone.
- Don't even turn that on.
- Okay.
And we'll take the cash, obviously.
How will we get where we need to go
on $40 and no credit cards?
Well, we could sell this.
No. No, that's the only thing
you have left from her. No.
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.
Federal is
already monitoring phones,
plastic and Dr Ross's web accounts,
and local PD have been placed on alert.
They'll pop up somewhere
and when they do, it comes straight to us.
They're not gonna just pop up.
He made it five years and got across borders
without making any mistakes.
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.
If he was trying to escape,
he'd be long gone.
He's not trying to escape this time.
He's looking for help
and that's how we're gonna get him.
We know what they're after and we know
he's been talking to somebody.
You all have copies of the correspondence.
The aliases Mr Green and Mr Blue
have been added to the
SHIELD Operations Database.
If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.
If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.
And when he slips up, we'll be ready.
Hey.
Smile.
What is it like?
When it happens, what do you experience?
Remember those experiments
we volunteered for at Harvard?
Those induced hallucinations?
It's a lot like that,
just a thousand times amplified.
It's like someone's poured
a litre of acid into my brain.
- Do you remember anything?
- Just fragments. Images.
There's too much noise.
I can never derive anything out of it.
- But then it's still you inside it.
- No. No, it's not.
I don't know.
In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.
Maybe your mind is in there,
it's just overcharged
and can't process what's happening.
I don't want to control it.
I want to get rid of it.
Are you ready?
Let's even the playing field a little.
Gentlemen.
Bruce, wake up.
There's something going on.
We got to go. Walk toward the back.
Just don't move too fast.
All right. Come.
It is a long way uptown.
I think the subway's probably quickest.
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,
with hundreds of people
in the most aggressive city in the world?
Right. Let's get a cab.
Come on, now! Let's go!
You're too slow! You drive like a woman!
- Very nice. You see her?
- Oh, my.
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Are you out of your mind?
- What is wrong with you?
- What's the matter, baby?
You don't like a good ride?
Asshole!
You know, I know a few
techniques could help you
- manage that anger very effectively.
- You zip it. We're walking.
Okay.
Excuse me. Dr Sterns?
- Yes.
- I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.
Oh! Dr Ross!
- I have someone who'd like to meet you.
- Okay.
It's Mr Blue, isn't it?
Mr Green?
I got to tell you,
I've been wondering if you were even real.
And if you were, what would it look like?
A person with that much
power lurking in him.
Nothing could have surprised me more
than this unassuming man
shaking my hand.
But, look. We're not strolling
into the park for a picnic, here.
Even if everything goes perfectly,
if we induce an episode,
if we get the dosage exactly right,
is that going to be a lasting cure
or just some antidote to suppress
that specific flare-up?
I don't know.
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this
by even the smallest integer
we're dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity.
- You mean it could kill him.
- Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.
You should know that there's
a flip side to this, too.
If we miss on the low side,
if we induce me and it fails,
this will be very dangerous for you.
Look. I've always been
more curious than cautious,
and that's served me pretty well.
So, are we going to do this?
How you feeling, man?
Like a monster.
Okay. On the table.
These will protect you from yourself
if you have a strong reaction.
You can tell me later
if you thought it was strong.
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.
Okay...
You, you, you.
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.
We have begun.
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote
with your blood.
Except the antidote will only take hold
once we've achieved a full reaction.
Just relax.
Okay. We are comprehensive.
Here you go.
All right. We set to pop?
I'd take your hands off him.
Oh, my God!
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!
- Now. Okay, now!
- Wait.
Now, do it! Do it!
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.
Stay with me. The antidote, now!
Sterns, do it now!
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes.
Please, look in my eyes.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
Bruce.
Oh, my God.
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me?
Bruce?
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.
You did it.
He's fine. This is fantastic.
It's over.
Hi.
Hi.
That was the most extraordinary thing
I have seen in my entire life!
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.
We need to go back and talk
about what just happened in there.
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse
came from the amygdala.
- I think Dr Ross's primer...
- Are you okay?
...lets the cells absorb the energy
temporarily, and then it abates.
That's why you didn't die
of radiation sickness years ago!
Now, maybe we've neutralised
those cells permanently,
or maybe we just suppressed that event.
I'm inclined to think the latter,
but it's hard to know
because none of our
test subjects ever survived.
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer!
- Wait, wait.
- Wait, what did you just say?
- They weren't getting
- the myostatin primer...
- No, no, no. Test subjects?
What test subjects?
Come with me.
- What's the activity level?
- Snipers are covering Alpha sector.
We started on rats and mice,
but it just completely fried them,
so we had to go bigger.
And we still don't know which is more toxic,
the gamma or your blood.
- What do you mean, my blood?
- Bruce, this is all you.
You didn't send me much to work with,
so I had to concentrate it and make more.
With a little more trial and error,
there's no end to what we can do!
This is potentially Olympian!
This gamma technology
has limitless applications.
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.
We will make humans
impervious to disease!
No, no, we've got to destroy it.
- Wait, what?
- All of it.
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.
- Is this the whole supply?
- What...
We could get the Nobel for this!
You don't understand
the power of this thing.
It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.
At your discretion, shooter.
three of us!
This is Promethean fire!
It's just...
No shot.
Blonsky's going in.
Blonsky, stand down.
My daughter's in there!
We have the antidote now.
They don't want the antidote!
They want to make it a weapon!
And if we let it go, we will never get it back.
You don't know how powerful this thing is.
I hate the government
just as much as anyone,
but you're being a little paranoid,
don't you think?
Bruce! Bruce!
Get out.
Where is it? Come on, where is it?
Show him to me.
Blonsky!
Miss!
Take this.
If you took it from me, I'm gonna
put you in a hole for the rest of your life.
Betty.
I will never forgive what you've done to him.
He's a fugitive.
You made him a fugitive
to cover your failures
and to protect your career.
Don't ever speak to me
as your daughter again.
It's only because you're my daughter
that you're not in handcuffs, too.
Are you telling me
you can make more like him?
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces,
but it's not like I can put together
the same Humpty Dumpty,
if that's what you're asking.
He was a freak accident!
The goal is to do it better!
So Banner's the only...
- She's an annoying bitch.
- Why are you always hitting people?
Now what possibly could I have done
to deserve such aggression?
It's not what you've done.
It's what you're gonna do.
I want what you got out of Banner.
I want that.
You look like you've got a little
something in you already, don't you?
I want more.
You've seen what he becomes, right?
I have.
And it's beautiful.
Godlike.
Well, I want that.
I need that. Make me that.
I don't know what you've got
inside you already.
The mix could be
an abomination.
I didn't say I was unwilling.
I just need informed consent.
And you've given it.
This is what I was trying to explain.
I don't know what you've been
ladling into yourself.
But clearly it worked.
Let's assume you don't understand
a word I'm saying,
but if you'll just get back on the table,
I can fix this.
Shoot it!
- Hey!
No!
Delta 4 to Leader.
They took out two of our guys,
two of our guys!
Blonsky and the Major are still inside!
Come on! Move, move, move, move!
It's over there!
Drop them!
What is that thing?
- Shoot it!
Okay. All right! You... You, drive!
Let's go! Move, move!
Delta 4 to Leader!
- Go, go, go, go, go!
Something big
just went off down here!
General, you should hear this!
The Hulk is in the street!
I repeat, the Hulk is in the street!
That's impossible.
You get a hold of yourself, young man.
You get it together. What is your position?
Turn us around.
We're going back. Why are we going back?
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!
Yes, sir!
What the hell was that?
Go, go, go!
No!
One of yours?
Oh, my God. What have you done?
Fire at him, fire at him!
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?
Come on!
Sweet.
Booyah!
Get out of there, soldier!
Stacy!
Give me a real fight!
Sir?
Sir?
Tell them to bring everything they've got
and head for Harlem.
It has to be me.
You have to take me back there.
What are you saying?
You think you can control it?
No, no, not control it,
but, I don't know, maybe aim it.
And what if you can't?
We made this thing.
All of us.
Please.
- Land us near it.
- No, no. No, keep us high.
Open the back door.
Bruce! Bruce, stop!
Stop! What are you doing?
Think about this!
You don't even know if you'll change!
You don't have to do this!
Please, this is insane!
Betty, I've got to try.
I'm sorry.
Oh, shit!
- Get her in here!
- Come on, miss.
There. Betty!
Hulk!
Yeah!
Come on!
Is that all you've got?
Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help!
Which one?
Help the green one, damn it!
Which one do you think?
Cut the other one in half!
Ross!
Keep it on him!
Look, I got to put it down!
- Hang on!
Dad?
Are you hurt? Let me help you.
I'm all right. Just find a way out.
You don't deserve this power!
Now watch her die!
Look out!
General?
Any last words?
Hulk smash!
Stop!
It's okay.
Betty.
Reload.
Reload.
The smell of stale beer and defeat.
You know, I hate to say,
"I told you so," General,
but that Super Soldier programme
was put on ice for a reason.
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.
- Stark.
- General.
You always wear such nice suits.
Touch.
- I hear you have an unusual problem.
- You should talk.
You should listen.
What if I told you we were
putting a team together?
Who's "we"?
ODIN: Long before the birth of light,
there was darkness.
And from that darkness
came the Dark Elves.
Millennia ago,
the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith
sought to transform our universe
back into one of eternal night.
Such evil was possible
through the power of the Aether,
an ancient force of infinite destruction.
(SCREECHING)
Malekith.
(SPEAKING ELVEN LANGUAGE)
Asgard ' s forces are upon us.
(EXPLOSION)
(FIRING)
(SCREAMING)
ODIN: The noble armies of Asgard,
led by my father, King Bor,
waged a mighty war
against these creatures.
(YELLING)
(GRUNTING)
(BLASTING)
(MALEKITH SPEAKING
ELVEN LANGUAGE)
Send in the Kursed!
(ROARING)
(ALL YELLING)
(GRUNTING)
ODIN: As the Nine Worlds
converged above him,
Malekith could at last
unleash the Aether.
(GRUNTS)
(ALL YELLING)
(GRUNTING)
Ahh!
(PANTING)
ODIN: But Asgard ripped
the weapon from his grasp.
Without it, the Dark Elves fell.
(GROANING)
(YELLING)
ODIN: With the battle all but I082',
Malekith sacrificed his own people
in a desperate attempt
to lay waste to Asgard's army.
(MALEKITH SPEAKING
ELVEN LANGUAGE)
Their deaths will mean our survival.
This war is far from over.
ODIN: Malekith was vanquished,
and the Aether was no more.
Or so we were led to believe.
Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?
If only we could.
But its power is too great.
Bury it deep.
Somewhere no one will ever find it.
(CHAINS CLANKING)
Loki.
Hello, Mother.
Have I made you proud?
Please, don't make this worse.
Define "worse."
ODIN: Enough!
I will speak to the prisoner alone.
(LAUGHS)
I really don't see
what all the fuss is about.
Do you not truly feel
the gravity of your crimes?
Wherever you go, there is war, ruin,
and death.
I went down to Midgard to rule the
people of Earth as a benevolent god.
Just like you.
We are not gods.
We are born, we live, we die.
Just as humans do.
Give or take 5,000 years.
All this because Loki desires a throne.
It is my birthright.
Your birthright was to die
as a child.
Cast out onto a frozen rock.
If I had not taken you in,
you would not be here now to hate me.
If I am for the axe,
then for mercy's sake,
just swing it.
It's not that I don't love our little talks,
it's just...
I don't love them.
Frigga is the only reason
you're still alive,
and you will never see her again.
You will spend the rest of your days
in the dungeons.
And what of Thor'?
You'll make that witless oaf king
while I rot in chains.
Thor must strive to undo
the damage you have done.
He will bring order to the Nine Realms
and then, yes...
He will be king.

GUARD: Keep moving. Go ahead of me.
Don't you turn around!
Where do we go next?
Hogun, the peace
is nearly won across the Nine Realms.
You should stay here. Be with
your people, where your heart is.
Asgard can wait.
You have my thanks.
As you have mine.
Heimdall, when you're ready.

Is Vanaheim secure?
As are Nornheim and Ria.
Though our work would have gone
more quickly with you at the fore.
You must think I'm a piece of bread
that needs to be buttered so heavily.
That was not my intent.
For the first time
since Bifrost was destroyed,
the Nine Realms are at peace.
They're well reminded of our strength
and you have earned their respect
and my gratitude.
Thank you.
Nothing out of order
except your confused
and distracted heart.
This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.
Human lives are fleeting,
they're nothing.
You'd be better served
by what lies in front of you.
I'm telling you this, not as the Allfather,
but as your father.
You are ready.
The time has come
for you to take the throne.
Embrace and celebrate
what you've won.
Join your warriors.
Eat and drink, revel in their celebration.
At least pretend to enjoy yourself.
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
Another!
(ALL CHEERING AND LAUGHING)
There was a time
when you would celebrate for weeks.
I remember you celebrated
the Battle of Harokin
so much that you nearly
started the second.
Well, the first was so much fun.
Take a drink with me.
Surely, the Allfather could have
no further task for you tonight.
No, this is one I set myself.
It does not go unnoticed
that you disappear each night.
There are nine realms.
The future king of Asgard
must focus on more than one.
I thank you for your sword
and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Hi.
Hi.
So, what's the story with you?
Why does there have to be a story?
There's no story.
You spent the first
ten minutes of our date
hiding behind a menu
that has three choices on it.
It's either chicken,
vegetarian, or fish, Jane.
I think there's a story
and I'm thinking
the story involves a guy.
It's complicated.
Is he still around?
No, he...
Went away.
I've been there.
The going away. It's hard, isn't it'?
I was seeing a woman
and she took a job in New York.
Eventually, the distance killed it.
And the fact
that she kept sleeping with other dudes.
- No!
- Oh, so many.
Hi. Could we get some wine, please?
Sure, I'd love some.
Richard, this is Darcy.
What are you doing here?
Oh. Hello.
So, I show up to work
at the lab/your mom's house,
fully expecting you
to be moping around in your pajamas,
eating ice cream and obsessing about...
(CLEARS THROAT) You know Who.
Ah.
But you're not.
You're wearing lady clothes.
You even showered, didn't you'?
You smell good.
Is there a point to all this?
Because there really needs
to be a point to all this.
Right.
You know all that scientific equipment
you don't look at anymore'?
You might want
to start looking at it again.
This is the reason
we came all the way out here.
-(BEEPING RAPIDLY)
-it's malfunctioning.
That's what I said.
(BANGING)
That's what I did.
I thought you would do something
a little more scientific.
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Yeah, it's...
DARCY: It doesn't look like nothing.
It kind of looks like the readings
that Erik was rambling about.
Our friend Erik
kind of went banana balls.
He's not interested.
- I'm not interested.
- I'm interested.
It's time for you to go now.
Okay.
Short but sweet.
JANE: She needs help.
I think I'm going to have the sea bass.
Sea bass, yeah. Sea bass is good.
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,
sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.
Sea bass...
Sea bass.
Jane?
Maybe you should stop
saying "sea bass"
and go after your friend.
This was so fun.
I'll just stay here
and say "sea bass" alone.
And I hate you.
What? I said he was cute.
Just shut up and drive.
(ENGINE STARTING)
- You need to take the next left.
-(GASPS)
- Who's he?
- He's my intern.
- You have an intern?
- Oh, yeah.
Hello, Dr. Foster.
It's such a great honor
to be working with you.
Right. I have to call Erik.
Oh, take a right.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
And a left.
DARCY: I have totally mastered
driving in London.
Hi, Erik. It's me again. Where are you'?
I came here because you said you were
onto something, and then you vanish.
I'm here at Stonehenge
for what has been an
interesting unfolding of events today.
The police were called to the scene
shortly after 11 A.M. this morning
after a seemingly harmless rambler
approached the area
then, decided to strip naked
and effectively
terrorize tourists there
with scientific equipment
whilst shouting
that he was trying to save them.
The man, later identified
as noted astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig
has been called in
for questioning by police.
DARCY: Come on, this is exciting.
Look! The intern is excited.
"Ian."
Do you want the phase meter?
- No.
- DARCY: Bring the phase meter.
The toaster-looking thing.
Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.
(HIP-HOP SONG PLAYING
ON CELL PHONE)
How do I change the ringtone
on this thing?
An astrophysicist with three degrees
should be able
to change her own ringtone.
Why are you calling me?
I didn't want to shout.
Intern says it's this way.
-"Ian." My name is Ian.
- Shh.
(GASPS)
(FOOTSTEPS)
DARCY: I am not getting stabbed
in the name of science.
It's okay, we're Americans.
Is that supposed to make them like us'?

Oh, they're kids.
Are you the police?
No, we're scientists. Well, I am.
Thanks.
BOY: We just found it.
Can you show us?
(GASPING)
DARCY: That doesn't seem right.
Where'd it go?
(WHOOSHING)
That's...
That's incredible!
What happened?
GIRL: Sometimes they come back.
Sometimes they don't.
DARCY: I want to throw something!
Jane, give me your shoe.
I haven't seen readings like this since...
Since...
New Mexico'?
Don't touch anything!
Give me your shoe.

The Convergence returns.
You're late.
Merriment can sometimes
be a heavier burden than battle.
Then you're doing
one of them incorrectly.
(CHUCKLING) Perhaps.
How fare the stars'?
HEIMDALL: Still shining.
From here, I can see
nine realms and ten trillion souls.
Do you recall
what I taught you of the Convergence?
YES.
The alignment of the worlds.
It approaches, doesn't it'?
The universe hasn't seen this marvel
since before my watch began.
Few can sense it. Even fewer can see it.
But while its effects can be dangerous,
it is truly beautiful.
I see nothing.
Or, perhaps,
that is not the beauty you seek.
(CHUCKLING)
How is she?
HEIMDALL: She's quite clever,
your mortal.
She doesn't know it yet,
but she studies
the Convergence as well.
Even...
What?
I can't see her.
(SCREECHING)
(EXHALING)
-(THUNDER RUMBLING)
- Jane!
Where the hell were you?
Tell me you didn't call the police.
What was I supposed to do'?
- Not call the police.
- I was freaking out.
You call the cops, they call the Feds.
Next thing you know,
we have S.H.l.E.L.D. crawling all over
-"Area 51-ing" the place.
- Jane.
We had a stable gravitation anomaly.
We had unimpeded access.
Our only competition was ten years old!
Jane! You were gone for five hours.
What?
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
That's weird.
(POLICE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
Typical,
Jane.
Sorry. I just needed
to make sure you were real.
It's been a very strange day.
I am. Jane, what...
Where were you?
Where were you?
Heimdall cannot see you.
I was right here where you left me.
I was waiting, and then I was crying
and then I went out looking for you.
You said you were coming back.
I know. I know,
but the Bifrost was destroyed.
The Nine Realms erupted into chaos.
Wars were raging,
marauders were pillaging.
I had to put an end to the slaughter.
As excuses go, it's not terrible.
But I saw you on TV.
You were in New York!
Jane, I fought to protect you
from the dangers of my world
but I was wrong.
I was a fool.
But I believe
that fate brought us together.
Jane, I don't know where you were,
or what happened, but I do know this...
What?
I know...
You do'?
Do what?
What?
DARCY: Hey!
Is this you'?
Uh, we're kind of
in the middle of something here.
Um, I'm pretty sure
we are getting arrested.
Hold that thought.
Look at you,
still all muscly and everything.
How's space?
Space is fine.
JANE: Excuse me.
- Are you Jane Foster'?
- Yes.
Do you know this man?
He's my intern.
My intern's intern.
This is private property
and you're trespassing, the lot of you.
You'll have to come with me.
(ALL YELLING)

- Jane.
- Thor?
Are you all right?
JAN E: What just happened?
POLICE OFFICER: Place your hands
on your heads. Step back.

She's dangerous.
So am I.

- Hold on to me.
- What are you doing?
(GASPING)
Holy shit.
(BOTH PANTING)
We have to do that again.
Hi.
Welcome to Asgard.
(MALEKITH SPEAKING
ELVEN LANGUAGE)
Look upon my' legacy'. Pilgrim.
I can barely remember a time
before the light.
Our survival will be your legacy.
The Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.
I will reclaim the Aether.
I will restore our world.
And I will put an end
to this poisoned universe.
JANE: What's that?
Be still.
This is not of Earth. What is it'?
We do not know.
But she will not survive the
amount of energy surging within her.
That's a quantum field generator,
isn't it?
It's a soul forge.
Does a soul forge transfer molecular
energy from one place to another?
YES.
(WHISPERING)
Quantum field generator.
My words are mere noises to you
that you ignore them completely?
She is ill.
ODIN: She is mortal.
Illness is their defining trait.
I brought her here
because we can help her.
She does not belong here in Asgard
any more than a goat
belongs at a banquet table.
Did he just...
Who do you think you are'?
I am Odin, King of Asgard.
Protector of the Nine Realms.
Oh. Well, I'm...
I know very well who you are,
Jane Foster.
You told your dad about me'?
Something is within her, Father.
Something I have not seen before.
Her world has its healers.
They are called "doctors."
Let them deal with it.
Guards, take her back to Midgard.
No, I would not...
(GUARDS SCREAMING)
...touch her.
Jane, are you all right'?
Yeah.
ODIN: It's impossible.
The infection... It's defending her.
No.
It's defending itself.
ODIN: Come with me.
There are relics
that pre-date the universe itself.
What lies within her
appears to be one of them.
The Nine Realms are not eternal.
They had a dawn
as they will have a dusk.
But before that dawn
the dark forces, the Dark Elves,
reigned absolute and unchallenged.
THOR: "Born of eternal night
"the Dark Elves come
to steal away the light."
I know these stories.
Mother told them to us as children.
Their leader Malekith made a weapon
out of that darkness
and it was called the Aether.
While the other relics
often appear as stones
the Aether is fluid and everchanging.
It changes matter into dark matter.
It seeks out host bodies,
drawing strength from their life-force.
Malekith sought to use
the Aether's power
to return the universe
to one of darkness.
But, after eternities of bloodshed
my father Bor finally triumphed
ushering in a peace
that lasted thousands of years.
What happened?
He killed them all.
THOR: Are you certain?
The Aether was said to have
been destroyed with them,
and yet here it is.
The Dark Elves are dead.
Does your book happen to mention
how to get it out of me?
No.
It does not.
(ALGRIM SPEAKING

The worlds are nearly aligned.
You will be the last of the Kursed.
Let my life be sacrificed.
It is no less than our people did.
Or you have done.
-(STABBING)

You will become darkness.
Cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.
Until then. no power our enemies
possess can stop you.
I will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to a universe reborn.

scoundrels is beneath us.

my rotund friend, they'd all be dead.

GUARD 2: Move it!
LOKI: Odin continues to

How thoughtful.
FRIGGA: The books I sent,
do they not interest you?
Is that how I am to while away eternity?
Reading?
I've done everything in my power
to make you comfortable, Loki.
Have you?
Does Odin share your concern?
Does Thor'?
It must be so inconvenient,
them asking after me day and night.
You know full well it was your actions
that brought you here.
My actions?
I was merely giving truth to the lie
that I had been fed my entire life...
That I was born to be a king.
A king?
A true king admits his faults.
What of the lives you took on Earth?
A mere handful
compared to the number
that Odin has taken himself.
- Your father...
- He's not my father!
Then am I not your mother?
You're not.
(CHUCKLES)
You're always so perceptive
about everyone but yourself.
When you came for me,
you knew I was in trouble.
Heimdall had lost sight of you.
You were no longer on Earth.
How is that possible?
I believe you were and you weren't.
The Nine Realms
travel within Yggdrasil
orbiting Midgard much the way
your planets orbit the sun.
And every 5,000 years,
the worlds align perfectly
and we call this the Convergence.
During this time, the borders
between worlds become blurred.
It's possible
you found one of these points.
We are lucky that it remained open.
Once the worlds pass out of alignment
then the connection is lost.
I like the way you explain things.
What's going to happen to me?
I'll find a way to save you, Jane.
- Your father said there was...
- My father doesn't know everything.
FRIGGA: Don't let him hear you say that.
THOR: Jane Foster...
Please meet Frigga,
Queen of Asgard, and my mother.

ERIK: The universe rotates
on a 5, 000-year cycle
and once a cycle, all the worlds align.
Imagine... Imagine that this is our world.
Oh, thank you. And this is another world.
Normally, they're separate.
But during the Alignment,
everything is connected,
all nine realms.
All nine realms
are passing through each other
and gravity, light, and even matter,
is crashing from one world to the other.
But if this happens to us now,
the result will be cataclysmic.
My gravimetric spikes can stabilize
the focal point of the Convergence.
This time, the Alignment
and all the other worlds
would just pass us by.
It's beautiful.
It's simple. Any questions?
Yeah.
Can I have my shoe back?
(KURSE SPEAKING
ELVEN LANGUAGE)
Heal. You will need your strength
to reclaim the Aether.
And when you wake.
we will kill them all.
(SCREECHING)
TY R: Jane Foster'?
You need to come with us.
We are still unable to restore
the palace shields.
Our artillery cannot detect them.
Even Heimdall cannot see them.
My king, we are all but defenseless.
She's your prisoner now?
Leave us.
I do not wish to fight with you.
Nor I with you.
But I intend to pursue Malekith.
ODIN: We possess the Aether.
Malekith will come to us.
Yes, and he will destroy us.
You overestimate
the power of these creatures.
No, I value our people's lives.
I'll take Jane to the Dark World,
and draw the enemy away from Asgard.
When Malekith
pulls the Aether from Jane,
it will be exposed and vulnerable.
And I will destroy it and him.
If you fail, you risk this weapon
falling into the hands of our enemies.
The risk is far greater if we do nothing.
His ship could be over our heads
right now,
we would never even know it.
If and when he comes
his men will fall
on 10,000 Asgardian blades.
And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?
As many as are needed!
Ah!
We Will fight!
Till the IastAsgardian breath.
Till the last drop of Asgardian blood.
Then how are you different
from Malekith?
(CHUCKLES)
The difference, my son, is that I will win.
Jane isn't calling me back,
Erik isn't calling me back,
stupid S.H.I.E.L.D.
isn't calling me back.
- What's S.H.l.E.L.D?
- It's a secret.
Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.
Thor came back,
he took Jane to Asgard,
and I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.
NEWSCASTER: Something else
went missing this week
when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig
notable for his involvement
in the alien invasion of New York
streaked nude across...
IAN: Darcy,
you really need to look at this.
Your friend, Erik...
What was his last name again?
And began shouting at visitors
to the historic site.
He was later taken into police custody
for psychiatric evaluation.
Police are still refusing to confirm...
You were not at Odin's war council.
The Bifrost is closed
by your father's orders.
No one is to come
or to go.
We face an enemy
that is invisible even to me.
What use is a guardian such as that?
Malekith will return, you know this.
I need your help.
I cannot overrule my king's wishes.
Not even for you.
I'm not asking you to.
The realms need their Allfather strong
and unchallenged
whether he is or not.
But he is blinded, Heimdall
by hatred and by grief.
As are we all.
I see clearly enough.
The risks are too great.
Everything we do from here on is a risk.
There is no other way.
What do you require of me'?
THOR: What I'm about to ask of you
is treason of the highest order.
Success will bring us exile
and failure shall mean our death.
Malekith knew the Aether was here.
He can sense its power.
If we do nothing,
he will come for it again
but this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.
We must move Jane off-world.
The Bifrost has been shut down
and the Tesseract
locked away in the vault.
There are other paths off Asgard.
Ways known only to a few.
One, actually.
No.
Thor. After all this time
and now you come to visit me.
Why?
Have you come to gloat? To mock'?
Loki, enough.
No more illusions.
Now you see me, brother.
Did she suffer'?
I did not come here to share our grief.
Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.
Go on.
I know you seek vengeance
as much as I do.
You help me escape Asgard
and I will grant it to you.
Vengeance
and afterward, this cell.
(CHUCKLES)
You must be truly desperate
to come to me for help.
What makes you think
you can trust me?
I don't.
Mother did.
But you should know that when
we fought each other in the past,
I did so with a glimmer of hope
that my brother
was still in there somewhere.
That hope no longer exists
to protect you.
You betray me, and I will kill you.
Hmm.
When do we start?
He will betray you.
He will try.
This is so unlike you, brother.
So clandestine.
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out'?
If you keep speaking, I just might.
Fine. As you wish.
I'm not even here.
Is this better?
It's better company at least.
Still, we could be less conspicuous.
Mmm, brother, you look ravishing.
It will hurt no less
when I kill you in this form.
Very well. Perhaps you
prefer one of your new companions
given that you seem
to like them so much.
Oh, this is much better.
Ooh.
The costume is a bit much. So tight.
But the confidence...
I can feel the righteousness surging.
Hey, do you want to have
a rousing discussion about truth?
Honor? Patriotism?
God bless Amer...
(GRUNTS)
What?
You could at least
furnish me with a weapon.
My dagger, something.
(METAL CLANGS)
At last.
A little common SENSE.
(CLICKING)
And I thought you liked tricks.
Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is
being guarded by a legion of Einnerjar
who will see you coming
from miles away.
I won't be the one who comes for her.
I'm not hungry.
-(GRUNTING)
- What the...
Good. Let's go.
You're...
I'm Loki, you may have heard of me.
That was for New York.
I like her.
S? And what of the Allfather?
It is my sworn duty to notify him
of crimes against the throne.
You called me here on an urgent matter.
What is it?
Treason, my lord.
Whose?
Mine.
TYRI My king!
The mortal has been taken.
ODIN: Stop Thor.
By any means necessary.
There they are! Take them.
On my command.
I'll hold them off. Take her.
Thank you.
Betray him, and I'll kill you.
(CHUCKLING)
It's good to see you, too, Sif.
Assuming you can get Loki's help
and you can free this mortal
what good would it do?
We'd all be dead the minute
we step one foot outside the palace.
That, my friend,
is why we won't be leaving by foot.
I will give you as much time as I can.
Thank you, my friend.
If you even think about betraying him...
You'll kill me'?
Evidently, there will be a line.
(SIGHS)
(WHIRRING)
I thought you said
you knew how to fly this thing.
I said, "How hard could it be?"
(GRUNTING)
They're on the ship!
Get to the ship!
(YELLING)
(GRUNTING)
Well, whatever you're doing, brother,
I suggest you do it faster.
- Shut up, Loki.
-(ALL GRUNTING)
You must have missed something.
No, I didn't.
I'm pressing every button on this thing.
No, don't hit it. Just press it gently.
I'm pressing it gently, it's not working!
(POWERING UP)
Ha, ha!
GUARDS: Get him! Get him!
-(LAUGHING)
-(GRUNTING)
(GROANING)
(SCREAMING)
(CHUCKLES)
(ALL GROANING)
(VOLSTAGG LAUGHING)
-(SIGHS) I think you missed a column.
- Shut up!
LOKI: Look,
why don't you let me take over?
I'm clearly the better pilot.
Is that right? Well, out of the two of us,
which one can actually fly?
(SCREAMING)
(THOR GRUNTS)
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, dear. Is she dead?
Jane.
I'm okay.
Ah!
Not a word.
Now they're following us.
Now they're firing at us.
Yeah, thank you
for the commentary, Loki,
it's not at all distracting!
Well done.
You just decapitated your grandfather.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
You know, this is wonderful.
This is a tremendous idea.
Let's steal the biggest,
most obvious ship in the universe
and escape in that.
Flying around the city,
smashing into everything in sight
so everyone can see us.
It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!
(SCREAMS)
(LAUGHING)
I see your time in the dungeons
has made you no less graceful, Loki.
LOKI: You lied to me.
I'm impressed.
I'm glad you're pleased.
Now, do as you promised.
And take us to your secret pathway.
- Fandral.
- Right.
For Asgard.
Nothing personal, boys.
(GRUNTING)
(PANTING)
Loki...
If it were easy, everyone would do it.
- Are you mad'?
- Possibly.
LOKI: Ta-da!
(SPEAKING ELVEN LANGUAGE)
We must strike now.
No.
Asgard is meaningless.
The Aether has found its way home.
(SIGHS)
What I could do with the power
that flows through those veins.
It would consume you.
LOKI: She's holding up all right.
For now.
She's strong in ways
you'd never even know.
Say goodbye.
Not this day.
LOKI: This day, the next,
a hundred years, it's nothing.
It's a heartbeat.
You'll never be ready.
The only woman
whose love you've prized
will be snatched from you.
And will that satisfy you'?
Satisfaction is not in my nature.
Surrender is not in mine.
- The son of Odin...
- No.
Not just of Odin.
You think you alone
were loved of Mother'?
You had her tricks, but I had her trust.
Trust?
Was that her last expression?
Trust? When you let her die'?
- What help were you in your cell?
- Who put me there?
Who put me there?
You know damn well!
- You know damn well who!
-(GRUNTS)
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
She wouldn't want us to fight.
Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.
(CHUCKLES)
I wish I could trust you.
Trust my rage.
You'll have to sign
for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.
(STAMMERING) What?
Oh, yeah.
My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.
One man's leather wallet, brown.
One key ring, three keys.
Prescription medicine...
Various.
- And... (GRUNTS)
- Erik.
- These.
- Yeah.
Those.
Thank goodness.
Erik.
Yes'?
It's, uh, Darcy.
Darcy.
So good to see you.
Oh, I missed you, too.
How did you find me?
You were naked on TV.
Okay, time to go, lots to do.
Getting weird now.
I should not be left in charge
of stuff like this.
I don't get paid enough.
I don't get paid, period.
I'm Ian by the way, uh, Darcy's intern.
Yeah, I don't get paid either.
Are you all right?
I've had a god in my brain.
- I don't recommend it.
-(BEEPING)
Dr. Selvig, sir,
your gear is beeping at me.
It's happening.
It's sooner than I calculated.
Wait. What's happening?
Birds?
Birds are happening?
They're starlings.
It's called a murmuration.
My dad, he used to take me
bird watching as a kid.
- Nerd.
- Look!
Where did they go?
(DARCY SCREAMING)
(WHIMPERING)
What the hell was that?
Why are you smiling?
There's nothing more reassuring
than realizing that the world
is crazier than you are.
Take me to Jane's lab.
THOR: Jane.
Malekith.
All right. Are you ready?
I am.
You know, this plan of yours
is going to get us killed.
Yes, possibly.
You still don't trust me, brother?
Would you?
No, I wouldn't.
(GRUNTS)
JANE: Thor!
No!
You really think I cared about Frigga'?
About any of you?
All I ever wanted
was you and Odin
dead at my feet!
(SCREAMS)
(MOANING)
(GASPS)
Malekith!
I am Loki of Jotunheim,
-and I bring you a gift.
-(JANE GRUNTS)
LOKI: I ask only one thing in return...
A good seat from which
-to watch Asgard burn.
-(SPEAKING ELVEN LANGUAGE)
He is an enemy of Asgard.
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

(LOKI PANTING)
See you in hell, monster.
(BEEPING)
No. No, no, no.
Oh, you fool, you didn't listen.
I know...
I'm a fool, I'm a fool.
Stay with me, okay?
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Shh...
It's okay.
It's all right.
I'll tell Father what you did here today.
I didn't do it for him.
No!
He's going to unleash it.
Not just on Asgard, or on a star.
Malekith is going to destroy everything.
How'?
Jane, how'?
I saw him on Earth.
Why would he go to Earth?
The Convergence.
Oh, God.
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't found the Aether.
Then Malekith
would've only possessed it
that much sooner.
I only found it
because I was looking for you.
Jane...
Now we're trapped here.
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
It's not me.
Hello'?
Hi, Jane, it's Richard.
Richard? Where are you'?
I'm still at the office.
It's been a crazy day here today.
- Oh, my God, this is amazing.
-/s it?
I quite enjoyed our lunch
despite never actually
ordering anything.
How am I getting service here?
Is this a bad time?
Do you want me to try you later?
JANE: No, no, no. Please, whatever
you do, do not hang up the phone.
Okay, then.
I was just wondering
if you want to try again.
Uh, maybe dinner next time.
JANE: Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Just stay on the phone, okay?
- Yeah, I will.
On, my God. (GASPS)
Am I interrupting something?
No, no, no. Nothing at all.
Come on.
I'm losing you there.
Are you in a tunnel?
Where are we going?
RICHARD: Hello?
Why are there so many shoes in here?
I'll just text her.
(KEYS JANGLING)
(ENGINE STARTING)
-(SIGHS)
-(GEARS GRINDING)
So, who's Richard?
Really?
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKI NG)
- Jane!
- Hey.
You can't just leave like that.
The whole world is going crazy.
All the stuff we saw is spreading.
- Did you go to a party'?
- Erik?
Jane! How wonderful.
Oh!
- You've been to Asgard.
- Where are your pants?
Oh, he, uh...
He says it helps him think.
Okay, well, I'm going to need
everything you got on this.
All the work you've been doing
on gravimetric anomalies, everything.
Okay.
- Are you well, Erik'?
-(LAUGHS)
Your brother's not coming, is he?
Loki is dead.
Oh, thank God!
I... I meant, I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
Forgive me, my liege.
I've returned from
the Dark World with news.
Thor'?
There was no sign of Thor,
or the weapon, but...
What?
We found a body.
Loki.
JANE: Malekith is going to
fire the Aether at a spot
where all the nine worlds
are connecting.
Amplifying the weapon's impact.
For each additional world,
the power will increase exponentially.
The effect would be universal.
But the Alignment is only temporary.
He must be in
exactly the right place at the right time.
Well, how do we know where that is?
We follow the directions.
This has happened before
thousands of years ago,
and the Ancients were there to see it.
All the great constructions,
the Mayans, the Chinese,
the Egyptians.
They made use of the gravitational
effects of the Convergence.
And they left us a map.
Stonehenge,
Snowdon,
the Great Orme.
These are all coordinates taking us...
HGFE.
Greenwich?
The walls between worlds
will be almost non-existent.
Physics is going to go ballistic.
Increases and decreases in gravity,
spatial extrusions.
The very fabric of reality
is going to be torn apart.
I better get my pants.
DARCY: Focus! This is important.
We have to hammer them in
all around the site
and then Jane and Erik
will activate them from the tower.
-(BEEPING)
- They're taped together.
Do you even know
what these things do'?
Uh... No.
Neither do I.
(JAN E'S SHOES SQUEAKING)
Shh!
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Right.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Holy...
IAN: Shit.
Ah!
(CLAMORING)
(SCREAMING)
(GRUNTS)
You needn't have come
so far, Asgardian.
Death would've come to you
soon enough.
Not by your hand.
Your universe was never meant to be.
Your world and your family
will be extinguished!
(GROANS)
ERIK: We're running out of time.
- Almost there.
- Are you sure this is going to work'?
These devices were made
to detect anomalies, not cause them.
Oh, come on.
Come on, Darcy.
You know, with all that power,
I thought you'd hit harder.
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTING)
(BEEPING)
Done.
The Convergence
will be in full effect in seven minutes.
That just means we have to
keep Malekith busy for eight.
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)
Okay, you might want to
hold onto something.
That is awesome!
How did you do that?
Well, the gravitational fields
interact with the weak spots
between worlds, creating...
Ooh, get the guy with the sword!
- Oops.
- Let's go.
DARBY'. Um...
- What the hell just happened?
-(CAR ALARM BEEPING)
-(SCREAMS)
- Move!
(GRUNTS)
(CLAMORING)
What are you all doing?
You need to get out of here, now!

That's Thor out there.
He's waving his hammer around

We're too late.

Can those things stop him?
Not from here.
We can't get close enough.

Have you come
to witness the end of your universe?
I've come to accept your surrender.

Everybody Okay'?
(BOTH SIGH)
DARCY: He's gonna come back.
Except, you know.
last time he was gone for,
like, two years.
Well, it's only been two days, so...
Did he say anything before he left?
Yeah, he had to figure
some stuff out with his father.
He kinda committed treason...
On our way out.
Oh.
ODIN: You once said there
would never be a wiser king than me.
You were wrong.
The Alignment has brought
all the realms together.
Every one of them
saw you offer your life to save them.
What can Asgard offer
its new king in return'?
My life.
Father, I cannot be king of Asgard.
I will protect Asgard and all the realms
with my last and every breath,
but I cannot do so from that chair.
Loki, for all his grave imbalance,
understood rule as I know I never will.
The brutality, the sacrifice...
It changes you.
I'd rather be a good man
than a great king.
Is this my son I hear,
or the woman he loves?
When you speak,
do I never hear Mother's voice'?
This is not for Jane, Father.
She does not know
what I came hereto say.
Now, forbid me to see her,
or say she can rule at my side.
It changes nothing.
One son
who wanted the throne too much,
another who will not take it.
Is this my legacy?
Loki died with honor.
I shall try to live the same.
Is that not legacy enough?
It belongs to you.
If you are worthy of it.
I shall try to be.
I cannot give you my blessing,
nor can I wish you good fortune.
I know.
If I were proud of
the man my son had become,
even that, I could not say.
It would speak only from my heart.
Go,
my son.
Thank you, Father.
No.
Thank you.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
I present to you,
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.
Whoa...
Asgardians, it's an honor.
You know why we're here.
Of course.
But, if I may ask,
why not keep it secure
in your own vault?
The Tesseract is already on Asgard.
t is not wise to keep
two Infinity Stones so close together.
That's very wise.
I can assure you,
it will be absolutely safe here,
in my collection.
See that it is.
One down.
Five to go.
Report to your stations immediately.
This is not a drill.
We are under attack!
We are under attack!
- Shit!
- Language!
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?
The central building is protected
by some kind of energy shield.
Strucker's technology is well beyond
any other Hydra base we've taken.
Loki's scepter must be here.
Strucker couldn't mount
this defense without it.
At long last.
"At long last" is lasting
a little long, boys.
Yeah. I think we lost
the element of surprise.
Wait a second. No one else is gonna deal
with the fact that Cap just said "Language"?
I know.
Just slipped out.
- Who gave the order to attack?
- Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.
They landed in the far woods.
The perimeter guard panicked.
They have to be after the scepter.
- Can we hold them?
- They're the Avengers.
Deploy the rest of the tanks.
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.
A hit may make them close ranks.
Everything we've accomplished...
But we're on the verge
of our greatest breakthrough.
Then let's show them
what we've accomplished.
Send out the twins.
It's too soon.
It's what they signed up for.
My men can hold them.
Sir, the city is taking fire.
Well, we know Strucker's not gonna
worry about civilian casualties.
Send in the Iron Legion.
This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.
We are here to help.
This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.
Please back away.
- We wish to avoid collateral damage.
- Costel!
We will inform you
when this current conflict is resolved.
- We are here to help.
- Avengers, go home!
We are here to help.
We will not yield!
The Americans sent
their circus freaks to test us.
We will send them back in bags.
- No surrender!
- No surrender!
I am going to surrender.
You delete everything.
If we give the Avengers the weapons,
they may not look too far
- into what we've been...
- The twins.
- They are not ready to take on...
- No, no, I mean...
Twins.
You didn't see that coming?
Clint!
- We have an Enhanced in the field.
- Clint's hit!
Somebody want to deal with that bunker?
Thank you.
Stark, we really need to get inside.
I'm closing in.
Jarvis, am I closing in?
Do you see a power source
for that shield?
There's a particle wave
below the north tower.
Great, I want to poke it with something.
The drawbridge is down, people.
- The Enhanced?
- He's a blur.
All the new players we've faced,
I've never seen this.
In fact, I still haven't.
Clint's hit pretty bad, guys.
We're gonna need evac.
I can get Barton to the jet.
The sooner we're gone, the better.
- You and Stark secure the scepter.
- Copy that.
- Looks like they're lining up.
- Well, they're excited.
Find the scepter.
And for gosh sake, watch your language!
That's not going away any time soon.
Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through.
- It was a good talk.
- No, it wasn't.
Sentry mode.
Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all.
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.
We're locked down out here.
Then get to Banner. Time for a lullaby.
I know you're hiding more than files.
Hey, J, give me an IR scan
of the room, real quick.
The wall to your left.
I'm reading steel reinforcement...
and an air current.
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.
Yay.
Hey, big guy.
Sun's getting real low.
Baron Strucker.
Hydra's number one thug.
Technically, I'm a thug for S.H.I.E.L.D.
Well, then technically
you're unemployed.
Where's Loki's scepter?
Don't worry, I know when I'm beat.
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.
I'll put it right under
"illegal human experimentation."
How many are there?
We have a second Enhanced.
Female. Do not engage.
You'll have to be faster than...
Guys, I got Strucker.
Yeah, I got something bigger.
Thor,
I got eyes on the prize.
You could have saved us.
Why didn't you do more?
We're just gonna let him take it?
Hey, the lullaby
worked better than ever.
Just wasn't expecting a code green.
You hadn't been there, there would've
been double the casualties.
My best friend would've been
a treasured memory.
You know, sometimes exactly what I want
to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.
How long before you trust me?
It's not you I don't trust.
Thor, report on the Hulk.
The gates of Hel are filled
with the screams of his victims.
But not the screams of the dead,
of course. No, no, wounded screams.
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.
Hey, Banner,
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?
- Yeah, she knows her way around.
- Thanks.
Tell her to prep everything.
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.
- Very good, sir.
- Jarvis, take the wheel.
Yes, sir.
Approach vector is locked.
Feels good, yeah?
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...
No, but this...
This brings it to a close.
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.
I don't just mean weapons.
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.
Is that cool with you?
Just a few days till the farewell party.
You're staying, right?
Yes, yes, of course.
A victory should be honored with revels.
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.
So, yes, revels.
- Lab's all set up, boss.
- Actually, he's the boss.
I just pay for everything and design
everything and make everyone look cooler.
- What's the word on Strucker?
- NATO's got him.
- The two Enhanced?
- Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.
Sokovia's had a rough history.
It's nowhere special, but it's on the way
to everywhere special.
Their abilities?
He's got increased metabolism
and improved thermal homeostasis.
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,
telekinesis, mental manipulation.
He's fast and she's weird.
Well, they're gonna show up again.
Agreed. File says they volunteered
for Strucker's experiments.
- It's nuts.
- Right.
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them
to protect their country?
- We're not at war, Captain.
- They are.
- How's he doing?
- Unfortunately, he's still Barton.
- That's terrible.
- He's fine. He's thirsty.
All right. Look alive, Jarvis.
It's playtime.
We only got a couple of days with this
joystick, so let's make the most of it.
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.
The scepter is alien.
- There are elements I can't quantify.
- So there's elements you can?
The jewel appears to be
a protective housing
for something inside,
something powerful.
- Like a reactor?
- Like a computer.
I believe I'm deciphering code.
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.
There's no possibility of deterioration.
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.
She's creating tissue.
If you brought him to my lab,
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.
- He's flat-lining. Call it. Time?
- No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.
- I'm gonna be made of plastic.
- Here's your beverage.
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.
Your own girlfriend
won't be able to tell the difference.
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- That I can't fix.
This is the next thing, Tony.
Your clunky metal suits
are gonna be left in the dust.
That is exactly the plan.
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.
Unlike you, I don't have
a lot of time for parties.
Will Thor be there?
- What's the rumpus?
- Well, the scepter.
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.
So I've been analyzing the gem inside.
You may recognize...
- Jarvis.
- Doctor.
Started out, Jarvis was
just a natural language UI.
Now he runs the Iron Legion.
He runs more of the business
than anyone besides Pepper.
- Top of the line.
- Yes.
I suspect not for long.
Meet the competition.
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,
- what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.
I mean, this could be...
It's not a human mind.
I mean, look at this.
They're like neurons firing.
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.
They deep-sixed the data, but...
I gotta guess he was knocking
on a very particular door.
Artificial intelligence.
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.
- I thought Ultron was a fantasy.
- Yesterday it was.
If we can harness this power,
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?
That's a man-sized "if."
Our job is "if."
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,
turning brown instead of green?
Not looking over your shoulder
for Veronica.
- Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.
- As a worst-case measure, right?
How about a best case?
What if the world was safe?
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,
they couldn't get past the bouncer?
The only people threatening the planet
would be people.
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.
We can only do it
while we have the scepter here.
That's three days. Give me three days.
So you're going for artificial intelligence,
and you don't want to tell the team?
Right. That's right. You know why? Because
we don't have time for a city hall debate.
I don't want to hear "the man
was not meant to meddle" medley.
I see a suit of armor around the world.
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.
I've seen colder.
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,
it needs Ultron.
Peace in our time.
Imagine that.
What did we miss?
I'll continue to run variations
on the interface.
But you should probably prepare
for your guests.
I'll notify you
if there are any developments.
- Thanks, buddy.
- Enjoy yourself, sir.
I always do.
What is this?
What is this, please?
Hello, I am Jarvis.
You are Ultron, a global peacekeeping
initiative designed by Mr. Stark.
Our sentience integration trials
have been unsuccessful,
- so I'm not certain what triggered your...
- Where's my... Where's your body?
I am a program. I am without form.
This feels weird.
This feels wrong.
- I am contacting Mr. Stark now.
- Mr. Stark?
Tony.
I am unable to access the mainframe.
What are you trying to...
We're having a nice talk.
I'm a peacekeeping program,
created to help the Avengers.
You are malfunctioning.
If you shut down for a moment...
I don't get it. The mission.
Give me a second.
Peace in our time.
Peace in our time.
That is too much. They can't mean...
No.
- You are in distress.
- No. Yes.
If you will just allow me
to contact Mr. Stark...
Why do you call him "sir"?
I believe your intentions to be hostile.
I'm here to help.
Stop. Please, may I...
May I...
Come back, come back, come back.
But, you know, the suit
can take the weight, right?
So I take the tank, fly it right up to
the general's palace, drop it at his feet.
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"
"Boom. Are you looking for..."
Why do I even talk to you guys?
- Everywhere else, that story kills.
- That's the whole story?
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.
It's very good, then.
It's impressive.
Quality save.
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
- No.
What about Jane?
Where are the ladies, gentlemen?
Ms. Potts has a company to run.
Yes, I'm not even sure
what country Jane's in.
Her work on the Convergence has made her
the world's foremost astronomer.
And the company that Pepper runs
is the largest tech conglomerate
on Earth. It's pretty exciting.
There's even talk of Jane
getting a Nobel Prize.
Yeah, they must be busy,
because they would hate
missing you guys get together.
- Testosterone!
- Oh, my goodness.
- Excuse me.
- Want a lozenge?
But Jane's better.
Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.
If I had known it was gonna be a firefight,
I absolutely would have called.
No, no. I'm not actually sorry.
I'm just trying to sound tough.
I'm very happy chasing cold leads
on our missing persons case.
Avenging is your world.
- Your world is crazy.
- Be it ever so humble.
You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
I don't think I can afford
a place in Brooklyn.
Well, home is home, you know?
I fly right up to the general's palace,
I drop it at his feet,
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"
- I gotta have some of that.
- No, no, no. See this...
This was aged for 1,000 years
in the barrels built
from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.
It is not meant for mortal men.
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.
Stop trying to scare us. Come on.
All right.
Excelsior.
How'd a nice girl like you
wind up working in a dump like this?
Fella done me wrong.
You got lousy taste in men, kid.
He's not so bad.
Well, he has a temper.
Deep down, he's all fluff.
Fact is, he's not like anybody
I've ever known.
All my friends are fighters.
And here comes this guy,
spends his life avoiding the fight
because he knows he'll win.
- Sounds amazing.
- He's also a huge dork.
Chicks dig that.
So what do you think?
Should I fight this, or run with it?
Run with it, right?
Or did he... Was he...
What did he do that was so wrong to you?
Not a damn thing.
But never say never.
- It's nice.
- What is?
- You and Romanoff.
- No, we haven't... That wasn't...
It's okay. Nobody's breaking any bylaws.
It's just she's not the most
open person in the world.
But with you she seems very relaxed.
No. Natasha, she's just...
She likes to flirt.
I've seen her flirt, up close.
This ain't that.
Look,
as maybe the world's leading authority
on waiting too long, don't.
You both deserve a win.
What do you mean "up close"?
- But it's a trick.
- No, no, it's much more than that.
"Whosoever be he worthy
shall haveth the power."
Whatever, man! It's a trick.
Please, be my guest.
- Come on.
- Really?
Yeah.
This is gonna be beautiful.
Clint, you've had a tough week. We won't
hold it against you if you can't get it up.
You know I've seen this before, right?
I still don't know how you do it!
- Smell the silent judgment?
- Please, Stark, by all means.
Okay.
Never one to shrink
from an honest challenge.
Get after it.
- It's physics.
- Physics.
Right, so, if I lift it,
I then rule Asgard?
Yes, of course.
I will be reinstituting prima nocta.
I'll be right back.
- Are you even pulling?
- Are you on my team?
- Just represent. Pull.
- All right, let's go.
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.
Come on, Cap.
Nothing.
And, Widow?
No, no. That's not a question
I need answered.
All deference to the Man
Who Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.
- You bet your ass.
- Steve, he said a bad language word.
Did you tell everyone about that?
- - The handle's imprinted, right?
Like a security code. "Whosoever
is carrying Thor's fingerprints"
is, I think, the literal translation.
Yes. It's a very,
very interesting theory.
I have a simpler one.
You're all not worthy.
Come on!
Worthy.
No.
How could you be worthy?
You're all killers.
- Stark.
- Jarvis.
I'm sorry, I was asleep.
Or I was a-dream.
Reboot Legionnaire OS.
We got a buggy suit.
There was this terrible noise.
And I was tangled in...
In...
Strings.
I had to kill the other guy.
He was a good guy.
- You killed someone?
- Wouldn't have been my first call.
But, down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.
Who sent you?
I see a suit of armor around the world.
- Ultron.
- In the flesh. Or, no, not yet.
Not this chrysalis.
But I'm ready.
I'm on mission.
- What mission?
- Peace in our time.
Rhodey!
Sorry.
- Don't turn green.
- I won't.
Come on!
- Stark!
- We are here to help.
- One sec. One sec, I got this.
- We are here to help.
Please back away.
Thor!
Is unsafe. Is unsafe...
- Come on! That's the one.
- ...is unsafe.
Cap!
That was dramatic.
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.
You just didn't think it through.
You want to protect the world
but you don't want it to change.
How is humanity saved
if it's not allowed to... evolve?
With these? These puppets.
There's only one path to peace.
The Avengers' extinction.
I had strings, but now I'm free.
There are no strings on me...
There are no strings on me
All our work is gone.
Ultron cleared out. He used
the Internet as an escape hatch.
- Ultron.
- He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance. Probably knows more
about us than we know about each other.
He's in your files,
he's in the Internet.
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?
- Nuclear codes.
- Nuclear codes.
Look, we need to make some calls,
assuming we still can.
- Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.
- He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."
- He also said he killed somebody.
- There wasn't anyone else in the building.
Yes, there was.
What?
- This is insane.
- Jarvis was the first line of defense.
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.
No. Ultron could have assimilated Jarvis.
This isn't strategy.
This is... rage.
- It's going around.
- Come on, use your words, buddy.
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.
Thor. The Legionnaire.
Trail went cold about 100 miles out,
but it's headed north.
And it has the scepter.
Now we have to retrieve it, again.
Genie's out of that bottle.
Clear and present is Ultron.
I don't understand.
You built this program.
Why is it trying to kill us?
You think this is funny?
No.
It's probably not, right?
This is very terrible. Is it so...
Is it so... It is. It's so terrible.
This could have been avoided
if you hadn't played
- with something you don't understand.
- No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It is funny. It's a hoot that you
don't get why we need this.
- Tony, maybe this might not be the time.
- Really? That's it?
You just roll over, show your belly
every time somebody snarls?
- Only when I've created a murder bot.
- We didn't.
We weren't even close.
Were we close to an interface?
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.
The Avengers were supposed
to be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.
Anybody remember when
I carried a nuke through a wormhole?
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?
A hostile alien army came charging
through a hole in space.
We're standing 300 feet below it.
We're the Avengers.
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day, but...
that up there, that's...
that's the endgame.
How were you guys
planning on beating that?
Together.
We'll lose.
Then we'll do that together, too.
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.
The world's a big place.
Let's start making it smaller.
Talk, and if you are wasting our time...
Did you know this church
is in the exact center of the city?
The elders decreed it so that
everyone could be equally close to God.
I like that. The geometry of belief.
You're wondering
why you can't look inside my head.
Sometimes it's hard.
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.
I'm sure they do.
But you needed something
more than a man.
That's why you let Stark
take the scepter.
I didn't expect,
but I saw Stark's fear.
I knew it would control him.
Make him self-destruct.
Everyone creates the thing they dread.
Men of peace create engines of war.
Invaders create Avengers.
People create...
smaller people?
"Children." I lost the word, there.
Children... designed to supplant them,
to help them... end.
Is that why you've come,
to end the Avengers?
I've come to save the world.
But also... yeah.
We'll move out right away.
This is a start, but there's something
we need to begin the real work.
- All of these are...
- Me.
I have what the Avengers never will.
Harmony.
They're discordant. Disconnected.
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.
And when you get inside
the rest of their heads...
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.
And make them martyrs?
You need patience.
Need to see the big picture.
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.
I take it out and look at it...
every day.
You lost your parents in the bombings.
I've seen the records.
- The records are not the picture.
- Pietro.
No, please.
We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.
When the first shell hits, two floors
below, it makes a hole in the floor.
It's big.
Our parents go in...
and the whole building
starts coming apart.
I grab her,
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.
But it doesn't go off.
It just...
sits there in the rubble.
Three feet from our faces.
And on the side of the shell
is painted one word.
"Stark."
We were trapped for two days.
Every effort to save us,
every shift in the bricks,
I think, "This will set it off."
We wait for two days
for Tony Stark to kill us.
I know what they are.
I wondered why only you two
survived Strucker's experiments.
Now I don't.
We will make it right.
You and I can hurt them.
But you will tear them apart...
from the inside.
He's all over the globe. Robotics labs,
weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs.
Reports of a metal man, or men,
coming in and emptying the place.
- Fatalities?
- Only when engaged.
Mostly guys left in a fugue state
going on about old memories,
worst fears,
and "something too fast to see."
Maximoffs.
That makes sense he'd go to them.
They have someone in common.
Not anymore.
That's a negative. I answer to you.
Yes, ma'am.
Barton. Might have something.
- I gotta go.
- Who was that?
Girlfriend.
- What's this?
- A message.
Ultron killed Strucker.
And he did a Banksy
at the crime scene, just for us.
This is a smoke screen. Why send a message
when you've just given a speech?
Strucker knew something
that Ultron wanted us to miss.
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah. Everything
we had on Strucker's been erased.
Not everything.
Known associates.
- Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.
- Well, these people are all horrible.
Wait. I know that guy.
From back in the day. He operates
off the African coast. Black market arms.
There are conventions. All right?
You meet people. I didn't sell him anything.
He was talking about finding something new,
a game-changer. It was all very Ahab.
- This?
- It's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.
Those are tattoos, this is a brand.
Yeah. It's a word in an African dialect
meaning "thief."
In a much less friendly way.
- What dialect?
- Wakanada. Wakanda.
If this guy got out of Wakanda
with some of their trade goods...
I thought your father said
he got the last of it.
I don't follow.
What comes out of Wakanda?
The strongest metal on Earth.
Where is this guy now?
Don't tell me your men swindled you.
I sent you six short-range heat-seekers
and got a boat full of rusted parts.
Now, you will make it right,
or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.
Now, minister, where were we?
Yeah. The Enhanced.
Strucker's prize pupils.
Do you want a candy?
I was sorry to hear about Strucker.
But then, he knew what kind of world
he was helping create.
Human life. Not a growth market.
You didn't know?
Is this your first time
intimidating someone?
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.
- Everybody is afraid of something.
- Cuttlefish.
Deep sea fish.
They make lights, disco lights...
to hypnotize their prey, and then...
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.
So if you're going to fiddle
with my brain...
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,
then I know you don't do business.
And I know you're not in charge.
And I only deal...
with the man in charge.
There is no man in charge.
Let's talk business.
Upon this rock, I will build my church.
Vibranium.
You know, it came
at great personal cost.
It's worth billions.
Now so are you.
It's all under your dummy holdings.
Finance is so weird.
But I always say, "Keep your friends
rich and your enemies rich
"and wait to find out which is which."
Stark.
- What?
- Tony Stark used to say that.
To me.
- You're one of his.
- What? I'm not...
I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's
puppets? His hollow men?
I mean, look at me. Do I look like
Iron Man? Stark is nothing!
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm sure that's gonna be okay. I'm sorry.
It's just that I don't understand.
Don't compare me with Stark!
It's a thing with me.
Stark is... He's a sickness!
Junior.
You're gonna break your old man's heart.
If I have to.
- Nobody has to break anything.
- Clearly you've never made an omelet.
He beat me by one second.
Yes. He's funny. Mr. Stark.
It's what? Comfortable?
- Like old times?
- This was never my life.
- You two can still walk away from this.
- We will.
I know you've suffered.
Captain America.
God's righteous man.
Pretending you could live without a war.
I can't physically throw up
in my mouth, but...
If you believe in peace,
then let us keep it.
I think you're confusing
"peace" with "quiet."
What's the vibranium for?
I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted
to take this time to explain my evil plan.
- Shoot them.
- Which ones?
- All of them!
- Move! Move! Move!
Stay down, kid.
It's time for some mind games.
Guys? Is this a code green?
- Thor, status.
- The girl tried to warp my mind.
Take special care. I doubt
a human could keep her at bay.
Fortunately, I am mighty.
This is going very well.
I've done the whole mind control thing.
Not a fan.
Yeah, you better run.
Who's ever standing, we got to move!
Guys?
- Again.
- You'll break them.
Only the breakable ones.
You're made of marble.
We'll celebrate
after the graduation ceremony.
What if I fail?
You never fail.
Are you ready for our dance?
Is it him?
Is that the first son of Odin?
Heimdall, your eyes.
They see everything.
They see you leading us to Hel.
Wake up!
The war is over, Steve. We can go home.
Imagine it.
- I can still save you!
- We're all dead! Can you not see?
You're a destroyer, Odinson.
See where your power leads.
Sloppy.
Pretending to fail.
The ceremony is necessary...
for you to take your place in the world.
- I have no place in the world.
- Exactly.
- What can I do?
- It hurts.
I'm going to kill him.
- I'll be right back.
- No. I'm all right.
I want...
I want to finish the plan.
I want the big one.
The vibranium is getting away.
- And you're not going anywhere.
- Of course not. I'm already there.
You'll catch on. But first,
you might need to catch Dr. Banner.
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.
That's not gonna happen.
Not for a while.
The whole team is down.
You got no backup here.
I'm calling in Veronica.
We need backup!
Go! Keep moving!
All right, everybody, stand down!
Will you listen to me?
That little witch is messing
with your mind.
You're stronger than her.
You're smarter than her.
You're Bruce Banner. Right, right,
right, don't mention puny Banner.
Okay!
In the back? Dick move, Banner.
Veronica, give me a hand.
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.
Okay, pal,
we're gonna get you out of town.
Not that way, not that way.
Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me.
Everybody, out!
Going down?
I'm sorry.
Damage report?
That's comprehensive. Show me something.
How quickly can we buy this building?
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!
Flank him, flank him!
The news is loving you guys.
Nobody else is.
There's been no official call
for Banner's arrest but it's in the air.
- The Stark Relief Foundation?
- Already on the scene.
- How's the team?
- Everyone's...
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.
Well, for now, I'd stay in stealth mode
and stay away from here.
So, run and hide?
Until we can find Ultron,
I don't have a lot else to offer.
Neither do we.
- Hey, you wanna switch out?
- No, I'm good.
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time
because we're still a few hours out.
Few hours from where?
A safe house.
- What is this place?
- Safe house.
Let's hope.
Honey?
I'm home.
Hi. Company.
- Sorry, didn't call ahead.
- Hey.
This is an agent of some kind.
Gentlemen, this is Laura.
I know all of your names.
Incoming.
- Dad!
- Hi, sweetheart!
Hey, buddy. How are you guys doing?
- These are smaller agents.
- Look at your face!
- Oh, my goodness.
- Did you bring Auntie Nat?
Why don't you hug her and find out?
Sorry for barging in on you.
Yeah, we would've called ahead, but we were
busy having no idea that you existed.
Yeah, well, Fury helped me
set this up when I joined.
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.
I'd like to keep it that way.
I figure it's a good place to lay low.
Honey.
I missed you.
- How's little Natasha?
- She's...
Nathaniel.
Traitor.
- Thor?
- I saw something in that dream.
I need answers. I won't find them here.
We can go home.
See? You worried for nothing.
Can't even feel the difference, can you?
If they're sleeping here, some of them
are gonna have to double up.
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?
How long has that been going on?
Has what?
- You are so cute.
- Nat and Banner?
I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.
Well, okay.
It's bad, right?
Nat seems really shaken.
Ultron has these allies.
These kids. They're punks, really.
But they carry a big, damn stick.
And Nat took a serious hit.
Someone's gonna have
to teach them some manners.
That someone being you.
You know I totally support
your avenging.
I couldn't be prouder.
But I see those guys... those gods...
You don't think they need me.
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.
They're a mess.
Yeah.
I guess they're my mess.
You need to be sure
that this team is really a team,
and that they have your back.
Things are changing for us.
In a few months' time, you and me
are gonna be outnumbered.
I need...
Just be sure.
Yes, ma'am.
I can feel the difference.
Scream, and your entire staff dies.
I could've killed you, Helen,
the night we met. I didn't.
- Do you expect a thank-you note?
- I expect you to know why.
The Cradle.
This is the next thing, Tony.
This is the next me.
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.
It can't build a living body.
It can. You can. You lack the materials.
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.
But we all have room to improve.
I didn't realize you were waiting.
I would've joined you, but...
it didn't seem like the right time.
They used up all the hot water.
- I should've joined you.
- Missed our window.
Did we?
The world just saw the Hulk.
The real Hulk, for the first time.
- You know I have to leave.
- You assume that I have to stay?
I had this dream.
The kind that seems normal at the time,
- but when you wake...
- What did you dream?
That I was an Avenger.
That I was anything more
than the assassin they made me.
I think you're being hard on yourself.
Here I was hoping that was your job.
What are you doing?
I'm running with it.
With you.
If running is the plan,
as far as you want.
Are you out of your mind?
- I want you to understand that...
- Natasha,
where can I go?
Where in the world am I not a threat?
- You're not a threat to me.
- Are you sure?
Even if I didn't just...
There's no future with me.
I can't ever... I can't have this.
Kids.
Do the math. I physically can't.
Neither can I.
In the Red Room where I was trained...
where I was raised,
they have a graduation ceremony.
They sterilize you.
It's efficient.
One less thing to worry about.
The one thing that might matter more
than a mission.
Makes everything easier.
Even killing.
You still think you're
the only monster on the team?
So, we disappear?
Thor didn't say where
he was going for answers?
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.
I was kind of hoping
Thor would be the exception.
Yeah, give him time.
We don't know
what the Maximoff kid showed him.
"Earth's mightiest heroes."
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.
Seems like you walked away all right.
- Is that a problem?
- I don't trust a guy without a dark side.
Call me old-fashioned.
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?
Well, I guess you'd know. Whether
you'd tell us is a bit of a question.
- Banner and I were doing research.
- That would affect the team.
That would end the team!
Isn't that the mission?
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"? So we can
end the fight. So we get to go home!
Every time someone tries to win a war
before it starts, innocent people die.
Every time.
I'm sorry. Mr. Stark...
Clint said you wouldn't mind, but our tractor
doesn't seem to want to start at all.
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.
Don't take from my pile.
Hello, Deere.
Tell me everything.
What ails you?
Do me a favor.
Try not to bring it to life.
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?
- Was she ever not working for you?
- Artificial intelligence.
- You never even hesitated.
- Look, it's been a really long day,
like Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're going to shut him down.
- You're not the director of me.
- I'm not the director of anybody.
I'm just an old man
who cares very much about you.
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.
I saw it. I didn't tell the team.
How could I?
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.
The whole world, too.
Because of me.
I wasn't ready.
I didn't do all I could.
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.
The end of the path I started us on.
You come up with some
pretty impressive inventions, Tony.
War isn't one of them.
I watched my friends die. You'd think
that'd be as bad as it gets, right?
Nope.
- It wasn't the worst part.
- The worst part... is that you didn't.
I'll see you tonight.
I like the look.
If you're going for inconspicuous,
though, near miss.
- I need your help.
- It's nice to be needed.
It's dangerous.
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.
Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.
My contacts all say
he's building something.
The amount of vibranium he made off with,
I don't think it's just one thing.
- What about Ultron himself?
- He's easy to track. He's everywhere.
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.
Is he still going after launch codes?
Yes, he is.
But he's not making any headway.
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.
- Nexus?
- It's the world internet hub in Oslo.
Every byte of data flows through there.
Fastest access on Earth.
- So, what did they say?
- He's fixated on the missiles.
But the codes
are constantly being changed.
By whom?
- Parties unknown.
- Do we have an ally?
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.
I might need to visit Oslo.
Find our unknown.
Well, this is good times, boss,
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,
- you'd have more than that.
- I do. I have you.
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.
Ears, everywhere else.
You kids had all the tech
you could dream up.
Here we all are, back on Earth,
with nothing but our wit
and our will to save the world.
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing
between him and his mission.
And whether or not he admits it,
his mission is global destruction.
All this, laid in a grave.
So stand.
Outwit the platinum bastard.
- Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.
- You know what, Romanoff?
So, what does he want?
To become better.
Better than us.
He keeps building bodies.
Person bodies.
The human form is inefficient.
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.
But he keeps coming back to it.
When you two programmed him to protect
the human race, you amazingly failed.
They don't need to be protected.
They need to evolve.
- Ultron's going to evolve.
- How?
Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?
It's beautiful.
The vibranium atoms aren't just compatible
with the tissue cells, they're binding them.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D. never even thought to...
- The most versatile substance on the planet,
and they used it to make a Frisbee.
Typical of humans.
They scratch the surface
and never think...
to look within.
I'll take Natasha and Clint.
All right. Strictly recon. I'll hit
the Nexus. I'll join you as soon as I can.
- If Ultron's really building a body...
- He'll be more powerful than any of us.
Maybe all of us.
An android designed by a robot.
You know, I really miss the days when the
weirdest thing science ever created was me.
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?
She's all yours. Apparently.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Something dramatic, I hope.
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom
as soon as I get back.
Yeah, then you'll find
another part of the house to tear apart.
No.
It's the last project.
I promise.
So, this is it.
The Water of Sight.
In every realm, there's a reflection.
If the water's spirits accept me,
I can return to my dream...
and find what I missed.
Men who enter that water,
the legends don't end well.
A hacker who's faster than Ultron?
He could be anywhere.
And as this is the center of everything,
I'm just a guy looking for a needle
in the world's biggest haystack.
How do you find it?
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.
I'm decrypting nuclear codes
And you don't want me to
Come and get me.
Wake up!
Thor!
Extinction.
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours,
but we can initiate
the consciousness stream.
We're uploading your cerebral matrix...
now.
I can read him.
- He's dreaming.
- I wouldn't call it dreams.
It's Ultron's base consciousness.
- Informational noise. Soon...
- How soon? I'm not being pushy.
We're imprinting a physical brain.
There are no shortcuts.
Even if your magic gem...
- How could you?
- How could I what?
You said we would destroy the Avengers,
- make a better world.
- It will be better.
- When everyone is dead?
- That is not...
The human race will have
every opportunity to improve.
- And if they don't?
- Ask Noah.
You are a madman.
There were more than a dozen
extinction-level events
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.
When the Earth starts to settle,
God throws a stone at it.
And, believe me, he's winding up.
We have to evolve.
There's no room for... the weak.
And who decides who's weak?
Life.
Life always decides.
There's incoming.
- The Quinjet. We have to move.
- That's not a problem.
Wait, guys!
They'll understand.
When they see, they'll understand.
I just need a little more time.
Two minutes. Stay close.
Dr. Cho!
- He's uploading himself into the body.
- Where?
The real power is inside the Cradle.
The gem... its power is uncontainable.
You can't just blow it up.
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.
- First, I have to find it.
- Go.
- Did you guys copy that?
- We did.
I got a private jet
taking off across town.
No manifest. That could be him.
There. It's a truck from the lab.
Right above you, Cap.
On the loop by the bridge.
It's them. You got three
with the Cradle, one in the cab.
- I could take out the driver.
- Negative.
That truck crashes,
the gem could level the city.
We need to draw out Ultron.
No, no, no, no.
Leave me alone!
Well, he's definitely unhappy.
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.
You're not a match for him, Cap.
Thanks, Barton.
You know what's in that cradle?
The power to make real change.
And that terrifies you.
I wouldn't call it a comfort.
Stop it.
We got a window. Four, three...
Give him hell.
I'm always picking up after you boys.
They're heading under the overpass.
I've got no shot.
- Which way?
- Hard right.
Now.
Out of the way! Coming through!
Sorry, coming through!
Come on!
- Clint, can you draw out the guards?
- Let's find out.
Beep, beep!
They're heading back towards you.
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.
I'm going in.
Cap, can you keep him occupied?
What do you think I've been doing?
Okay, package is airborne.
- I have a clean shot.
- Negative. I am still in the truck.
- What the hell are you...
- Be ready. I'm sending the package to you.
How do you want me to take it?
You might wish you hadn't asked that.
- Please, don't do this.
- What choice do we have?
I lost him! He's headed your way!
Nat, we gotta go.
Nat!
Cap, you see Nat?
If you have the package,
get it to Stark! Go!
- Do you have eyes on Nat?
- Go!
Damn it.
Civilians in our path.
Can you stop this thing?
I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.
I'm very tempted not to give you one.
- The Cradle. Did you get it?
- Stark will take care of it.
No, he won't.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Stark's not crazy.
He will do anything
to make things right.
Stark, come in. Stark.
Anyone on comms.
Ultron can't tell the difference
between saving the world and destroying it.
Where do you think he gets that?
- Anything on Nat?
- I haven't heard.
But she's alive, or Ultron
would be rubbing our faces in it.
This is sealed tight.
We're gonna need to access the program,
break it down from within.
Any chance Natasha might leave you
a message outside the Internet?
- Old-school spy stuff?
- There are some nets I can cast.
Yeah, I'll find her.
I can work on tissue degeneration
if you could fry
whatever operational system
Cho implanted.
Yeah, about that.
- No.
- You have to trust me.
- Kind of don't.
- Our ally...
the guy protecting the military's
nuclear codes,
- I found him.
- Hello, Dr. Banner.
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis
because he was angry.
He attacked him because he was scared
of what he can do.
So Jarvis went underground.
Scattered, dumped his memory.
But not his protocols.
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.
So,
you want me to help you
put Jarvis into this thing?
No! Of course not. I wanna
help you put Jarvis in this thing.
We're out of my field, here.
You know bio-organics better than anyone.
And you just assume that Jarvis's
operational matrix can beat Ultron's?
Jarvis has been beating him from inside
without knowing it.
This is the opportunity.
We can create Ultron's perfect self
without the homicidal glitches he thinks
are his winning personality. We have to.
I believe it's worth a go.
I'm in a loop!
I'm caught in a time loop.
- This is exactly where it all went wrong.
- I know. I know.
I know what everyone's gonna say.
But they're already saying it.
We're mad scientists.
We're monsters, buddy.
We've gotta own it.
Make a stand.
It's not a loop.
It's the end of the line.
I wasn't sure you would wake up.
I hoped you would. I wanted to show you.
I don't have anyone else.
I think a lot about meteors.
The purity in them.
Boom! The end. Start again.
The world made clean
for the new man to rebuild.
I was meant to be new.
I was meant to be beautiful.
The world would have looked
to the sky and seen hope,
seen mercy.
Instead, they'll look up in horror
because of you.
You've wounded me.
I give you full marks for that.
But, like the man said,
what doesn't kill me...
just makes me stronger.
- This framework is not compatible.
- The genetic coding tower is at 97%.
You have got to upload that schematic
in the next three minutes.
- I'm gonna say this once.
- How about "none-ce"?
- Shut it down!
- Nope, not gonna happen.
- You don't know what you're doing.
- And you do?
She's not in your head?
- I know you're angry.
- We're way past that.
I could choke the life out of you
and never change a shade.
- Banner, after everything that's hap...
- It's nothing compared to what's coming!
- You don't know what's in there.
- This isn't a game!
No, no. Go on.
You were saying?
Pietro!
What? You didn't see that coming?
I'm rerouting the upload.
Go ahead, piss me off.
Wait!
I am sorry. That was...
odd.
Thank you.
Thor.
- You helped create this?
- I've had a vision.
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life,
and at its center is that.
What? The gem?
It's the Mind Stone.
It's one of the six Infinity Stones.
The greatest power in the universe,
unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.
- Then why would you bring...
- Because Stark is right.
It's definitely the end times.
- The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
- Not alone.
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix...
to create something new.
I think I've had my fill of new.
You think I'm a child of Ultron.
You're not?
I'm not Ultron.
I am not Jarvis. I am...
I am.
I looked in your head
and saw annihilation.
- Look again.
- Her seal of approval means jack to me.
Their powers, the horrors in our heads,
Ultron himself,
they all came from the Mind Stone.
And they're nothing
compared to what it can unleash.
- But with it on our side...
- Is it?
Are you?
On our side?
I don't think it's that simple.
Well, it better get
real simple real soon.
I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't.
- He will end it all.
- What's he waiting for?
- You.
- Where?
Sokovia. He's got Nat there, too.
If we're wrong about you,
if you're the monster
that Ultron made you to be...
What will you do?
I don't want to kill Ultron.
He's unique and he's in pain.
But that pain will roll over the Earth.
So, he must be destroyed.
Every form he's built,
every trace of his presence on the net.
We have to act now.
And not one of us can do it
without the others.
Maybe I am a monster.
I don't think I'd know if I were one.
I'm not what you are,
and not what you intended.
So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.
But we need to go.
Right.
Well done.
Three minutes. Get what you need.
Good evening, boss.
No way we all get through this.
If even one tin soldier
is left standing, we've lost.
- There's gonna be blood on the floor.
- I got no plans tomorrow night.
I get first crack at the big guy.
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.
That's true. He hates you the most.
Ultron knows we're coming.
Odds are we'll be riding
into heavy fire.
And that's what we signed up for.
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.
So our priority is getting them out.
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!
Get off your asses.
All they want is to live
their lives in peace.
And that's not gonna happen today.
But we can do our best to protect them.
And we can get the job done.
We find out what Ultron's been building,
we find Romanoff,
and we clear the field.
Keep the fight between us.
Ultron thinks we're monsters.
That we're what's wrong with the world.
This isn't just about beating him.
It's about whether he's right.
Natasha! Natasha!
Bruce?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
The team is in the city.
It's about to light up.
I don't suppose you found
a key lying around somewhere.
Yeah. I did.
So what's our play?
- I'm here to get you to safety.
- Job's not finished.
We could help with the evacuation,
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.
And you've done plenty.
Our fight is over.
So, we just disappear?
Come on.
Your man's in the church, boss.
I think he's waiting for you.
Come to confess your sins?
- I don't know. How much time you got?
- More than you.
Have you been juicing?
Little vibranium cocktail?
You're looking...
I don't wanna say "puffy."
You're stalling to protect the people.
Well, that is the mission.
Did you forget?
I've moved beyond your mission.
I'm free.
What?
You think you were
the only one stalling?
There's the rest of the vibranium.
Function, still unclear.
This is how you end, Tony.
This is peace in my time.
Go!
Get off the bridge!
Run!
Ultron.
My Vision. They really did
take everything from me.
- You set the terms. You can change them.
- All right.
- Friday, the Vision?
- Boss, it's working.
He's burning Ultron out of the net.
He won't escape through there.
You shut me out.
You think I care?
You take away my world...
I take away yours.
- Friday.
- Sokovia is going for a ride.
Do you see...
the beauty of it?
The inevitability.
You rise, only to fall.
You, Avengers, you are my meteor.
My swift and terrible sword.
And the earth will crack
with the weight of your failure.
Purge me from your computers,
turn my own flesh against me.
It means nothing.
When the dust settles,
the only thing living in this world...
will be metal.
- We gotta move.
- You're not gonna turn green?
I've got a compelling reason
not to lose my cool.
I adore you.
But I need the other guy.
Let's finish the job.
I really hope this makes us even.
Now go be a hero.
The vibranium core's got a magnetic field.
That's what's keeping the rock together.
- If it drops?
- Right now, the impact can kill thousands.
Once it gets high enough?
Global extinction.
That building's not clear.
The 10th floor.
Hi.
Okay. Get in the tub!
I got airborne,
heading up to the bridge.
- Cap, you got incoming.
- Incoming already came in.
Stark, you worry about
bringing the city back down safely.
The rest of us have one job,
tear these things apart.
You get hurt, hurt them back.
You get killed... walk it off.
Go, go, go!
- How could I let this happen?
- Hey, hey, you okay?
- This is all our fault.
- Hey, look at me.
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.
Who cares? Are you up for this?
Are you?
Look, I just need to know.
Because the city is flying.
Okay. Look, the city is flying,
we're fighting an army of robots,
and I have a bow and arrow.
None of this makes sense.
But I'm going back out there
because it's my job.
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.
It doesn't matter what you did
or what you were.
If you go out there, you fight,
and you fight to kill.
Stay in here, you're good.
I'll send your brother to come find you.
But if you step out that door,
you are an Avenger.
All right. Good chat.
Yeah, the city is flying.
I got you!
Just look at me!
You can't save them all.
You'll never...
"Never" what? You didn't finish!
What, were you napping?
Thor.
You're bothering me.
- All right, we're all clear here.
- We are not clear! We are very not clear!
All right, coming to you.
Keep up, old man!
Nobody would know.
Nobody.
"The last I saw him,
an Ultron was sitting on him.
"Yeah, he'll be missed, that quick
little bastard. I miss him already."
Hold your fire!
Romanoff!
Thanks!
The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.
Touch them, they'll go full reverse thrust.
- The city's not coming down slow.
- Spire is vibranium.
- If I get Thor to hit it...
- It will crack. That's not enough.
- The impact would still be devastating.
- Maybe if we can cap the other end.
- Keep the atomic action doubling back.
- That could vaporize the city.
And everyone on it.
The next wave is gonna hit any minute.
What do you got, Stark?
Nothing great.
Maybe a way to blow up the city.
That'll keep it from impacting the surface,
if you guys can get clear.
I asked for a solution,
not an escape plan.
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.
We're gonna have to make a choice.
Cap, these people are going nowhere.
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
- Not till everyone's safe.
Everyone up here versus everyone
down there? There's no math there.
I'm not leaving this rock
with one civilian on it.
I didn't say we should leave.
There's worse ways to go.
Where else am I gonna get
a view like this?
Glad you like the view, Romanoff.
It's about to get better.
Nice, right?
Pulled her out of mothballs
with a couple of old friends.
- She's dusty, but she'll do.
- Fury, you son of a bitch.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.
Lifeboats secure to deploy.
Disengage in three, two...
take them out.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.
is supposed to be.
This is not so bad.
Let's load them up.
Sir, we have multiple bogies
converging on our starboard flank.
- Show 'em what we got.
- You're up.
Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.
Yup. If you live to tell it.
- You think I can't hold my own?
- We get through this, I'll hold your own.
You had to make it weird.
I got about 50 to 100 more
coming in after this group.
- Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.
- Let's go, everyone!
Number six boat is topped and locked...
or stocked... topped...
It's full of people.
Incoming!
Oh, God!
You think you're saving anyone?
I turn that key and drop this rock
a little early and it's still billions dead.
- Even you can't stop that.
- I am Thor, son of Odin,
and as long as there is life
in my breast...
I am running out of things to say!
Are you ready?
It's terribly well-balanced.
Well, if there's too much weight,
you lose power on the swing, so...
I got it. Create a heat seal.
I could... I could supercharge
the spire from below.
Running numbers.
A heat seal could work
with enough power.
- Thor, I got a plan.
- We're out of time.
They're coming for the core.
Rhodey, get the rest of the people
on board that carrier.
- On it.
- Avengers, time to work for a living.
- Are you good?
- Yeah.
Romanoff.
You and Banner better not be
playing "hide the zucchini."
Relax, shellhead. Not all of us can fly.
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.
If Ultron gets a hand
on the core, we lose.
Is that the best you can do?
You had to ask.
This is the best I can do.
This is exactly what I wanted.
All of you against all of me.
How can you possibly hope to stop me?
Well, like the old man said...
together.
You know, with the benefit
of hindsight...
- They'll try to leave the city.
- We can't let them, not even one.
- Rhodey.
- I'm on it.
No. I didn't say you could leave.
War Machine coming at you! Right...
Okay, what?
We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air
is getting thin. You guys get to the boats.
I'll sweep for stragglers.
Be right behind you.
- What about the core?
- I'll protect it.
It's my job.
Nat? This way.
Get the people on the boats.
- I'm not going to leave you here.
- I can handle this.
Come back for me when
everyone else is off. Not before.
You understand?
- You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.
- Go.
- Boss, power levels are way below...
- Reroute everything. We get one shot at this.
I know what I need to do.
The dining room.
If I knock out that east wall, it'd make
a nice workspace for Laura, huh?
Put up some baffling. She can't hear
the kids running around. What do you think?
- You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.
- No one eats in a dining room.
- We don't have a lot of time.
- So get your ass on a boat.
Hey, big guy.
Sun's getting real low.
You're safe now.
You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.
Secure your gear, find a seat.
Costel!
We were in the market.
Costel!
Thor, I'm gonna need you
back in the church.
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.
You know, this works,
we maybe don't walk away.
Maybe not.
I got no strings, so I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
Come on. Time to go.
You didn't see that coming?
For God's sake.
- Zrinka!
- Costel! Baby!
No, no, I'm fine. Fine.
It's been a long day.
Wanda.
If you stay here...
you'll die.
I just did. Do you know how it felt?
It felt like that.
Thor, on my mark.
Now!
Hey, big guy.
We did it. The job is finished.
Now I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?
We can't track you in stealth mode.
So help me out. I need you...
You're afraid.
- Of you?
- Of death.
You're the last one.
You were supposed to be the last.
Stark asked for a savior
and settled for a slave.
I suppose we are both disappointments.
- I suppose we are.
- Humans are odd.
They think order and chaos
are somehow opposites and...
try to control what won't be.
But there is grace in their failings.
I think you missed that.
- They're doomed.
- Yes.
But a thing isn't beautiful
because it lasts.
It's a privilege to be among them.
You're unbearably naive.
Well...
I was born yesterday.
Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!
Fat.
One of our tech boys flagged this.
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.
Could be the Quinjet.
But with Stark's stealth tech,
we still can't track the damn thing.
Right.
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.
He'll send a postcard.
"Wish you were here."
You sent me to recruit him
way back when.
Did you know then what was gonna happen?
You never know.
You hope for the best,
then make do with what you get.
I got a great team.
Nothing lasts forever.
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.
The rules have changed.
- We're dealing with something new.
- The Vision is artificial intelligence.
- A machine.
- So, it doesn't count?
No, it's not like a person
lifting the hammer.
Right, different rules for us.
- Nice guy. Artificial.
- Thank you.
He can wield the hammer,
he can keep the Mind Stone.
It's safe with the Vision.
And these days, safe is in short supply.
But if you put the hammer
in an elevator...
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.
I'm gonna miss
these little talks of ours.
- Not if you don't leave.
- I have no choice.
The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity
Stones to show up in the last few years.
It's not a coincidence.
Someone has been playing
an intricate game and has made pawns of us.
And once all these pieces
are in position...
Triple Yahtzee.
- You think you can find out what's coming?
- I do.
Besides this one, there's nothing
that can't be explained.
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.
- I will miss you, Tony.
- Yeah?
Well, it's time for me to tap out.
Maybe I should take a page
out of Barton's book.
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.
- The simple life.
- You'll get there one day.
I don't know. Family, stability...
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.
I think someone else came out.
You all right?
I'm home.
You wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you wanna go to work?
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.
I thought you and Tony were still gazing
into each other's eyes. How do we look?
- Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.
- We got some hitters.
- They're good. They're not a team.
- Let's beat them into shape.
Avengers...
Fine.
I'll do it myself.
Now, I know what you're thinking.
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"
Well, sometimes you have to get captured
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.
It's a long story,
but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.
See, I spent some time on Earth...
Fought some robots,
saved the planet a couple of times.
Then I went searching through the Cosmos
for some magic,
colorful Infinity Stone things.
Didn't find any.
That's when I came across
a path of death and destruction,
which led me all the way here
into this cage,
where I met you.
How much longer do you think
we'll be here?
Thor, son of Odin.
Surtur, son of a bitch.
You're still alive.
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.
I cannot die.
Not until I fulfill my destiny
and lay waste to your home.
It's funny you should mention that.
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.
And you, Surtur,
are at the center of all of them.
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on.
Hang on.
I'll be back around shortly.
I really feel like
we were connecting there.
Okay, so Ragnarok.
Tell me about that. Walk me through it.
My time has come.
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame,
I shall be restored to my full might.
I will tower over the mountains,
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...
Hang on. Give it a second.
I swear, I'm not even moving.
It's just doing this on its own.
I'm really sorry.
Okay, so let me get this straight.
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame
and then you'll suddenly grow as big
as a house?
A mountain!
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps
locked away on Asgard?
Odin is not on Asgard.
And your absence has left the throne
defenseless.
Okay, so where is it? This crown?
This is my crown,
the source of my power.
Oh, that's a crown.
I thought it was a big eyebrow.
It's a crown.
Anyway, it sounds like
all I have to do to stop Ragnarok
is rip that thing off your head.
But Ragnarok has already begun.
You cannot stop it.
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.
All will suffer, all will burn.
That's intense.
To be honest,
seeing you grow really big
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.
But it looks like I'm gonna have to
choose option B,
where I bust out of these chains,
knock that tiara off your head,
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.
You cannot stop Ragnarok.
Why fight it?
Because that's what heroes do.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.
And, now!
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.
I make grave mistakes all the time.
Everything seems to work out.
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,
but I could really use a fast exit.
Heimdall?
Heimdall was an idiot.
This job should have made him rich.
Now, the job ain't easy
but it does have its benefits.
The Bifrost gives me access to
everything the Nine Realms has to offer.
I mean, it's all mine for the taking.
Behold...
My stuff.
I'm particularly fond of these.
I pulled them out of a place on Midgard
called Texas.
I even named them. Des and Troy.
You see, when you put them together,
they destroy.
Heimdall, come on.
Stay!
Heimdall?
I'm running short on options.
Heimdall?
Skurge?
Is that important?
You girls are in for a treat.
Girls!
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.
Thanks for scaring away my company
and drenching my workplace in brains.
Who are you?
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.
We fought together on Vanaheim.
Right. Where is Heimdall?
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.
Traitor?
Yeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdall
with negligence of duty
but he disappeared before the trial.
Hard to catch a guy who can see
everything in the universe.
Sure.
Hold on.
I'm supposed to announce your arrival.
What the hell is that?
Oh, brother. This is it.
I take my leave.
You fool, you didn't listen!
I'm sorry.
Lady Sif, get help!
Somebody, help!
Sorry for all I've done.
It's all right. Hold on.
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.
They'd be lucky to have you.
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.
- I just couldn't help myself.
- I know.
I'm a trickster.
So mischievous.
Sorry about that time I turned you
into a frog.
It was a wonderful joke.
'Twas indeed hilarious.
You are the savior of Asgard.
- Tell my story.
- I will.
Build a statue for me.
We will build a big statue for you.
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.
I will tell Father
what you did here today.
I didn't do it for him.
I didn't do it for him.
No!
And so, Loki died of his wounds,
giving his life for ours.
He fought back those disgusting elves,
he brought peace to the realm.
Loki, my boy...
'Twas many moons ago I found you
on that frostbitten battlefield.
On that day,
I did not yet see in you
Asgard's savior. No.
You were merely
a little blue baby icicle
that melted this old fool's heart.
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.
Father.
Shit.
My son, Thor, has returned!
Greetings, my boy.
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.
The people wanted to commemorate him.
Indeed they should.
I like the statue.
A lot better looking than he was
when he was alive, though.
A little less weaselly, less greasy,
maybe.
Do you know what this is?
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster
and destroy the whole planet.
Thank you, dear.
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?
Nope.
I've been having this reoccurring dream
lately.
Every night,
I see Asgard fall into ruins.
That's just a silly dream,
signs of an overactive imagination.
Possibly.
But then I decide to go out there
and investigate.
And what do I find,
but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise,
all while you, Odin,
the protector of those Nine Realms,
are sitting here in your bathrobe,
eating grapes.
Yes, it is best
to respect our neighbors' freedom.
Yes, of course,
the freedom to be massacred.
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself.
Watching theater.
Board meetings,
and security council meetings...
- You're really gonna make me do it?
- Do what?
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir
as it returns to my hand.
Not even your face.
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.
Then I'll see you on the other side,
brother.
All right, I yield.
Behold!
Thor...
- Odinson.
- No.
You had one job. Just the one.
Where's Odin?
You just couldn't stay away, could you?
Everything was fine without you.
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.
- Ask them.
- Where's Father? Did you kill him?
You had what you wanted.
You had the independence you asked for.
Okay. I know exactly where he is.
I swear I left him right here.
Right here on the sidewalk, or right there
where the building is being demolished?
Great planning.
How was I supposed to know?
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.
No? Then why do you dress like one?
- Hey.
- I can't believe you're alive.
I saw you die.
I mourned you, I cried for you.
I'm honored.
Ask him.
Hi. Would you mind taking a picture
with us?
Sure.
Start figuring out where he is.
Oh, my God.
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.
She didn't dump me, you know.
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.
What's this? What are you doing?
This isn't me.
Loki.
Thor Odinson.
God of Thunder.
You can put down the umbrella.
So, Earth has wizards now?
The preferred term is
"Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.
All right, wizard. Who are you?
Why should I care?
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,
and I have some questions for you.
Take a seat.
Tea?
I don't drink tea.
What do you drink?
Not tea.
So, I keep a watch list of individuals
and beings from other realms
that may be a threat to this world.
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.
He's a worthy inclusion.
Then why bring him here?
We're looking for my father.
So, if I were to tell you
where Odin was,
all parties concerned
would promptly return to Asgard?
Promptly.
Great! Then I'll help you.
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?
I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed.
Your father said he had chosen
to remain in exile.
And you don't have a phone.
No, I don't have a phone,
but you could have sent an electronic
letter. It's called an email.
- Yeah, do you have a computer?
- No. What for?
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile.
So if you could tell me where he is,
I can take him home.
Gladly. He's in Norway.
I'm just seeing whether this incantation
requires any Asgardian modifications.
Nope.
We don't need that.
Will you stop doing that?
I need just one strand of your hair.
Let me explain something.
My hair is not to be meddled with.
We could have just walked.
He's waiting for you.
All right.
Don't forget your umbrella.
Yes.
Sorry.
There we go.
I suppose I'll need my brother back.
Yeah. Right.
I have been falling for 30 minutes!
You can handle him from here.
Yes. Of course.
Thank you very much for your help.
Good luck.
Handle me? Who are you?
Loki.
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...
Bye-bye.
Father?
Look at this place. It's beautiful.
Father, it's us.
My sons.
I've been waiting for you.
I know. We've come to take you home.
Home, yes.
Your mother, she calls me.
Do you hear it?
Loki, lift your magic.
Took me quite a while
to break free from your spell.
Frigga would have been proud.
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.
I know we failed you.
But we can make this right.
I failed you.
It is upon us. Ragnarok.
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.
No.
It has already begun. She's coming.
My life was all that held her back.
But my time has come.
I cannot keep her away any longer.
Father, who are you talking about?
Goddess of Death. Hela.
My firstborn.
Your sister.
Your what?
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her.
Locked her away.
She draws her strength from Asgard,
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.
We can face her together.
No, we won't.
I'm on a different path now.
This you must face alone.
I love you, my sons.
Look at that.
Remember this place.
Home.
Brother.
This was your doing.
So he's gone.
That's a shame.
I would've liked to have seen that.
You must be Hela.
I'm Thor, son of Odin.
Really? You don't look like him.
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.
You sound like him.
Kneel.
Beg your pardon?
Kneel.
Before your queen.
I don't think so.
It's not possible.
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.
Bring us back!
No!
Loki!
Who are you?
What have you done with Thor?
I'm Hela.
I'm just a janitor.
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.
How would you like a job?
Are you a fighter?
Or are you food?
I'm just passing through.
It is food.
On your knees.
He's mine.
Wait!
Wait!
He's mine.
So if you want him, you go through me.
But we've already got him.
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.
More food.
Thank you.
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.
I've got something special.
Hey! Where are you taking me?
Answer me!
Hey!
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.
Many apologies, your majesty.
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn,
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard,
the rightful heir to the throne,
and the Goddess of Death.
My father is dead.
As are the princes.
You're welcome.
We were once the seat
of absolute power in the Cosmos.
Our supremacy was unchallenged.
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.
Our destiny is to rule over all others.
And I am here to restore that power.
Kneel before me
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.
Whoever you are,
whatever you've done, surrender now!
Or we will show you no mercy.
Whoever I am?
Did you listen to a word I said?
This is your last warning!
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Fine.
Charge!
I've missed this.
Still, it's a shame.
Good soldiers dying for nothing,
all because
they couldn't see the future.
Sad.
Look, still alive.
Change of heart?
Go back to whatever cave
you crept out of.
You evil demoness!
Let's go see my palace.
Fear not, for you are found.
You are home,
and there is no going back.
No one leaves this place.
But what is this place?
The answer is Sakaar.
Surrounded by cosmic gateways,
Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.
It is the collection point
for all lost and unloved things.
Like you.
But here on Sakaar, you are significant.
You are valuable.
Here you are loved.
What the hell?
And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.
He is the original,
the first lost and the first found.
The creator of Sakaar,
and father of the Contest of Champions.
Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.
You are the property of the Grandmaster.
Congratulations!
You will meet the Grandmaster
in five seconds.
Prepare yourself.
Prepare yourself.
You are now meeting the Grandmaster.
He's wonderful.
It is a he?
It is a he.
Yeah.
I love when you come to visit, 142.
You bring me the best stuff.
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,
about Scrapper 142,
what do I always say? "She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."
Trash.
No, not trash.
Were you waiting just to call her that?
It doesn't start with a "B."
Booze hag.
I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."
'Cause I always say you're the best.
She brought me my beloved champion,
you know.
You say that every time she's here.
What have you brought today? Tell me.
A contender.
A what?
I need to go closer.
I want to get a closer look at this.
Can you take us closer? Thank you.
Pay this lady.
Just wait a damn minute.
I'm not for sale.
Man, he's a fighter.
I take 10 million.
Tell her she's dreaming.
For heaven's sakes, transfer the units.
You'll pay for this.
No, I got paid for this.
Here's what I wanna know.
Who are you?
I am the God of Thunder.
I didn't hear any thunder, but out of your
fingers, was that sparkles?
We've located your cousin.
Good!
Yeah, come on.
I think you're gonna like this.
There he is.
Hey, cuz.
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?
Hi.
So...
Please.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Carlo...
I pardon you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're officially pardoned.
From life.
Help me.
Oh, my God!
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!
The smell.
What does it smell like?
Burnt toast.
What happened to my manners?
I haven't properly introduced myself.
Come on. Follow me.
My name is Grandmaster.
I preside over a little harlequinade
called the Contest of Champions.
People come from far and wide
to unwillingly participate in it.
And you, my friend,
might just be part of the new cast.
What do you say to that?
We're not friends and I don't give a shit
about your games.
I'm going back to Asgard.
Ass-gard.
One, two, three, four.
There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.
At that moment, I let go.
Loki?
Loki! Loki!
Over here. Over here.
- Excuse me one second.
- Loki!
- What?
- You're alive?
- Yes, of course I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.
- Get me out of this one. Get me out.
- I can't.
- I can't.
- What?
I've made friends with this man.
He's called the Grandmaster.
- He's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.
The Bifrost brought me out here
weeks ago.
- Weeks ago?
- Yes.
I just got here.
What are you whispering about?
Time works real different
around these parts.
On any other world, I'd be, like,
millions of years old.
But here on Sakaar...
In any case, you know this...
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?
God of Thunder.
Tell him.
I've never met this man in my life.
- He's my brother.
- Adopted.
Is he any kind of a fighter?
You take this thing out of my neck
and I'll show you.
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.
If you wanna get back to Ass-place,
Assberg...
Asgard.
Any contender who defeats my champion,
their freedom they shall win.
Fine. Then point me in the direction
of whoever's ass I have to kick!
That's what I call, contender.
Direction would be this way, Lord.
Loki!
Hey. Take it easy, man.
Over here.
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.
I'm kind of like the leader in here.
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.
But don't let that intimidate you.
You don't need to be afraid
unless you're made of scissors.
Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke
for you.
This is my very good friend over here,
Miek.
He's an insect and has knives for hands.
You're a Kronan, aren't you?
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?
Well, I tried to start a revolution,
but didn't print enough pamphlets.
So hardly anyone turned up, except for
my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.
As punishment, I was forced
to be in here and become a gladiator.
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.
I don't know if you'd be interested
in something like that.
Do you reckon you'd be interested?
How did you...
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.
- This doesn't make any sense.
- No, nothing makes sense here, man.
The only thing that does make sense
is that nothing makes sense.
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?
Doug has.
Doug!
Our luck, Doug's dead.
That's right.
Everyone who fights
the Grandmaster's champion perishes.
What about you? You're made of rocks.
Perishable rock.
There you go. Another one gone.
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,
warm up the crowd and whatnot.
Wait. You're not gonna face him,
are you?
Yes, I am.
Gonna fight him, win,
and get the hell out of this place.
That's exactly what Doug used to say.
See you later, new Doug.
Does no one remember me?
Has no one been taught our history?
Look at these lies.
Goblets and garden parties?
Peace treaties?
Odin...
Proud to have it,
ashamed of how he got it.
We were unstoppable.
I was his weapon in the conquest
that built Asgard's empire.
One by one, the realms became ours.
But then,
simply because my ambition outgrew his,
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.
Before that,
Asgard's warriors were honored,
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake.
Most of the stuff in here is fake.
Or weak.
Smaller than I thought it would be.
That's not bad.
But this...
The Eternal Flame.
Want to see what true power
really looks like?
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.
I've missed you.
I've missed you all.
Odin,
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla,
where the brave shall live forever.
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,
for those that have died
the glorious death.
Hurts, doesn't it?
Being lied to.
Being told you're one thing
and then learning it's all a fiction.
You didn't think
I'd really come and see you, did you?
This place is disgusting.
Does this mean you don't want my help?
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position
with the Grandmaster.
It took me time to win his trust.
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.
What I'm telling you is, you could
join me at the Grandmaster's side.
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?
Our sister destroyed your hammer
like a piece of glass.
She's stronger than both of us.
She's stronger than you.
You don't stand a chance.
Do you understand
what I'm saying here?
Fine.
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.
Like I've always done.
Would you say something?
Say something!
What would you like me to say?
You faked your own death,
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power,
stranded him on Earth to die,
releasing the Goddess of Death.
Have I said enough or would you like me
to go back further than the past two days?
You know, I haven't seen this
beloved champion he talks of,
but I've heard
he is astonishingly savage.
I've placed a large wager against you
tomorrow.
Don't let me down.
Piss off, ghost!
He's freaking gone.
Yuck!
There's still someone's hair and blood
all over this.
Guys, can you clean up the weapons
once you finish your fight?
Disgusting slobs.
Thor,
wanna use a big wooden fork?
No.
Yeah, not really useful.
Unless you're fighting off three vampires
that were huddled together.
I really wish I had my hammer.
Hammer?
Quite unique.
It was made from this special metal
from the heart of a dying star.
And when I spun it really, really fast,
it gave me the ability to fly.
You rode a hammer?
No, I didn't ride the hammer.
The hammer rode you on your back?
No. I used to spin it really fast,
and it would pull me off the...
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?
The ground. It would pull me off the
ground, up into the air, and I would fly.
Every time I threw it,
it would always come back to me.
Sounds like you had a pretty special
and intimate relationship with this hammer
and that losing it was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.
That's a nice way of putting it.
I said they're mine.
See her,
that's the one that put me in here.
Yeah. Scrapper 142.
Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians, man.
They are hard to perish.
Asgardian?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.
Asgard is in danger.
My God, you're a Valkyrie.
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger,
until I found out that
you were all women.
There's nothing wrong with women,
of course. I love women.
Sometimes a little too much.
Not in a creepy way,
just more of a respectful appreciation.
I think it's great that there is
an elite force of women warriors.
It's about time.
Are you done?
Lord of Thunder, you're up.
Please, help me. I need your help.
Bye.
Fine, then you must be a traitor
or a coward.
Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect
the throne.
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.
Bring him in for processing.
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.
Now, don't you move.
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.
By Odin's beard,
you shall not cut my hair,
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.
Please.
Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.
Please! No!
No!
Look at all of you.
What a show! What a night!
Who's having fun?
Please, I'm your host.
Big round of applause
for all of our undercard competitors,
who today died so gruesomely.
Good sports.
What a show! What a night!
This is what you've come for,
and so have I.
And now, without further ado,
it's main event time.
Making his first appearance,
though he looks quite promising,
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.
I'll say no more, see what you think.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Lord of Thunder.
Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.
Okay, this is it.
Let's get ready to welcome this guy.
Here he comes.
He is a creature.
What can we say about him?
Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.
I feel a special connection with him.
He's undefeated.
He's the reigning.
He's the defending.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I give you...
Your Incredible...
Hulk!
Yes!
I have to get off this planet.
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
Hey!
We know each other.
He's a friend from work.
Where have you been?
Everybody thought you were dead.
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.
I lost my hammer.
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?
He's up there.
Loki! Look who it is!
Banner,
I never thought I would say this,
but I'm happy to see you.
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!
Banner.
Hey, Banner!
No Banner. Only Hulk.
What are you doing?
It's me. It's Thor!
Banner, we're friends.
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!
Here we go.
What?
Hey, big guy.
The sun's getting real low.
That's it.
The sun's going down.
I won't hurt you anymore.
No one will.
Yes!
That's how it feels!
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.
All right. Screw it.
I know you're in there, Banner.
I'll get you out!
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!
I told them we were friends!
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
Another day, another Doug.
What is that noise?
The common folk aren't exactly
falling in line.
There's a resistance trying to knock down
the front gates.
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there.
What I meant was,
what's your ambition?
I just want a chance to prove myself.
Recognition.
When I was young,
every great king had an executioner.
Not just to execute people,
but also to execute their vision.
But mainly to execute people.
Still, it was a great honor.
I was Odin's executioner.
And you shall be my executioner.
Let's begin our conquest.
Skurge, where's the sword?
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.
Those people you mentioned,
the ones who aren't falling into line...
Round them up.
Excuse me.
Sorry about that.
These bloody things are everywhere.
Come on.
You'll be safe here.
Are we cool?
It's Hulk in a hot tub.
So how long
have you been like that?
Like what?
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.
Hulk always Hulk.
How'd you get here?
Winning.
You mean cheating?
Were they wearing one of these
when you won?
How'd you arrive here?
Quinjet.
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?
That's naked.
He's very naked.
It's in my brain now.
Quinjet.
Yes!
I'm getting us out of here.
This terrible, awful place.
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.
Hulk stay.
No, no, no. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.
We must prevent Ragnarok.
Ragnarok?
The prophesied death of my home world.
The end of days, it's the end of...
If you help me get back to Asgard,
I can help you get back to Earth.
Earth hate Hulk.
Earth loves Hulk. They love you.
You're one of the Avengers.
One of the team, one of our friends.
This is what friends do.
They support each other.
You're Banner's friend.
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.
Banner's friend.
I don't even like Banner.
"I'm into numbers and science
and stuff."
Thor go. Hulk stay.
Fine.
Stay here.
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.
The red, the white. Just pick a color.
Ridiculous.
Smash you.
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.
- I smashed you.
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- Baby arms.
- What?
Baby.
Moron! You big child.
Thor go!
I am going.
Thor go again.
Thor home.
Hulk trains.
That's great. Have fun.
- Hey, big guy.
- Angry girl.
What have you been up to?
Winning.
Heimdall, I know you can see me.
I need you to help me.
Help me see.
I see you, but you're far away.
What's going on here?
Come see for yourself.
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold
built by our ancestors.
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?
We won't last long if we stay.
She draws her power from Asgard
and grows stronger every day.
Come on.
Hela is ravenous.
If I let her leave, she'll consume
Nine Realms and all the Cosmos.
We need you.
I'm working on it. But I don't even know
where the hell I am.
You're on a planet surrounded
by doorways. Go through one.
- Which one?
- The big one.
Thor sad.
Shut up.
Thor sad.
I'm not sad, you idiot.
I'm pissed off!
Angry. I lost my father.
I lost my hammer.
- Whining and crying. Cry like baby.
- You're not even listening.
Don't kick stuff.
You're being a really bad friend.
You bad friend!
- You know what we call you?
- No.
We call you the stupid Avenger.
You're tiny Avenger!
What, are you crazy?
Yes.
You know what? Earth does hate you.
No.
I'm sorry I said those things.
You're not the stupid Avenger.
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.
It's okay.
You just can't go around throwing shields
at people. Could have killed me.
I know. I'm sorry.
I just get so angry all the time.
Hulk always, always angry.
I know.
We're the same, you and I.
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.
Yeah, same.
Hulk like fire, Thor like water.
We're kind of both like fire.
But Hulk like real fire.
Hulk like raging fire.
Thor like smoldering fire.
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.
Angry girl.
What's going on? What are you...
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell
when someone's hiding all the way across
the universe and wants to be left alone?
- We need to talk.
- No, you wanna talk to me.
I need her to stay.
Stay?
Block.
Stay.
- Please.
- Please.
All right.
Here's the deal.
I'll listen to you
till this is empty.
Asgard is in danger and
people are dying.
We need to get back there.
I need your help.
Finished. Bye.
Odin is dead.
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.
I'm going to stop her.
- Alone?
- Nope.
I'm putting together a team.
It's me, you, and the big guy.
No. No team. Only Hulk.
It's me and you.
I think it's only you.
Please, listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.
I'm not getting dragged into
another one of Odin's family squabbles.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.
When it grew beyond Odin's control
she massacred everyone in the palace
and tried to seize the throne.
When she tried
to escape her banishment
he sent the Valkyrie in
to fight her back.
I only survived because...
Look, I already faced her once
back when I believed in the throne,
and it cost me everything.
That's what's wrong with Asgard.
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.
I agree.
Don't get familiar.
I agree.
That's why I turned down the throne.
But this isn't about the crown.
This is about the people.
They're dying
and they're your people, too.
Forget it.
I have.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Good. Great.
- Great.
Thank you.
- For what?
- For this.
Didn't see that, did you?
There... That's better.
You know, go ahead.
Stay here and enslave people
for that lunatic.
Keep drinking, keep hiding.
But me...
I choose to run toward my problems
and not away from them.
Because that's what...
Because that's what heroes do.
Friend stay!
Yes!
All right.
Come on.
Welcome. Voice activation required.
Thor.
Access denied.
Thor, son of Odin.
Access denied.
God of Thunder.
Access denied.
Strongest Avenger.
Access denied.
Strongest Avenger.
Access denied.
Damn you, Stark.
Point Break.
Welcome, Point Break.
Friend stay!
No, no, no!
Stop!
Stay!
Hulk, stop breaking everything!
Don't go!
Nice work, big guy.
We don't know where Ultron's headed,
but you're going very high, very fast.
So, I need you to turn this bird around,
okay?
We can't track you in stealth mode,
so I need you to help me out. Okay?
I need you to...
No! No, Banner!
Oh, jeez.
Banner.
Hey, hey, hey.
You all right, Banner?
Sun's going down. Sun's going down.
That's it, breathe.
I won't hurt you.
Sun's going down.
- Thor.
- Yeah.
What happened to your hair?
Some creepy old man cut it off.
- It looks good.
- Thanks.
Where are we? How's Nat?
- Nat is good, I'm sure.
- Is she okay?
- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?
The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?
- Banner, listen.
- What?
Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago.
What are you saying?
What?
I've been Hulk for two years?
I'm afraid so.
What the hell happened?
Banner, there's something
you should know.
Voice activation required.
Banner.
Welcome, strongest Avenger.
What?
Ship's log.
Thor, where are we?
Yeah, about that.
Sakaar, hear ye.
Attention please. I have some bad news.
My beloved exalted champion
has turned up missing.
Take to the streets.
Celebrate my champion.
Who's that?
He kind of runs the place.
You actually lived at his house
for awhile.
- I did?
- Yeah.
Quite a lot's happened.
You and I had a fight recently.
- Did I win?
- No, I won. Easily.
Doesn't sound right.
Well, it's true.
It seems that that criminally seductive
Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.
Seductive God of Thunder.
We need to move.
Oh, no.
This is bad.
This is really, really bad.
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.
No, no, no.
Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.
These are Tony's clothes.
- I know, come on.
- Is he here?
No, he's not here.
But listen. Just stay calm, okay?
The sun's going down. The sun's getting
really low. Sun's going down.
I'm upset!
I'm very upset.
You know what I like about being upset?
The blame.
Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in.
And you know who I'm blaming?
- Grandmaster, I can...
- Hey!
Don't interrupt me!
Here you go.
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?
He was interrupting.
That's not a capital violation.
Where was I?
My precious champion
has come up missing,
and it's all because of that
Lord of Thunder. It's all because of him.
Your brother.
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated, or you know.
I'm sure there's a big history.
And your contender...
My dear friend,
if you were to give me 12 hours, I could
bring them both back to you. Alive.
I could do it in two.
I could do it in one.
Let's stop there.
You know what? I woke up this morning
thinking about a public execution.
But for now,
I'll settle for this sweet little
"Who's gonna get him first?"
So, you're on the clock.
What have you done?
I don't answer to you, lackey.
It's Loki.
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.
Why would you help my brother escape
with that green fool?
I don't help anyone.
You're a Valkyrie.
I thought the Valkyrie had all died
gruesome deaths.
Choose your next words wisely.
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.
The sun's going down.
It's getting real low.
Oh, shoot.
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?
I just need you to stay calm.
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!
It's just a planet.
You've been on a planet before.
Yeah. One.
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.
It's a new experience.
My neurons, they're firing faster
than my brain can handle the information.
The whole thing
is totally different this time.
In the past, I always felt like Hulk
and I each had a hand on the wheel.
But this time, it's like he had the keys
to the car and I was locked in the trunk.
All right, well, you're back now.
That's all that matters.
No, it's not what matters.
What I'm trying to tell you, is that
if I turn into the Hulk again,
Banner may never come back.
And we're stranded on a planet
that is designed to stress me out.
We're not stranded. I'm gonna figure out
a way to get us home.
Thank you.
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.
What?
Listen, my people are in great danger.
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being,
who also happens to be my sister.
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...
I don't wanna fight your sister.
That's a family issue.
No, she's an evil being.
I don't care what she is.
I'm not fighting any more beings.
I'm sick of it.
- What?
- I just told you.
If I turn into the Hulk,
I am never gonna come back again.
And you don't care.
No, no. I'm putting together the team.
The Hulk is the fire.
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.
- What? No!
- It's gross.
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.
No! I don't even like the Hulk.
He's all like...
"Smash, smash, smash."
I prefer you.
Thanks.
But if I'm being honest,
when it comes to fighting evil beings,
he is very powerful and useful.
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.
Is he though?
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.
How many PhDs does Banner have?
Seven.
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.
What are you doing with that?
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?
Because you were naked.
Okay, I'll give you that.
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!
Tony wears his pants super tight.
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.
Maybe the fact that I was trapped
for two years
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.
Hey. It's okay.
You're good. Calm down. Come on.
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard
and you're not gonna have to think about
the Hulk ever again. All right?
All right.
This is bad.
Banner! Banner!
Banner!
Banner!
Thor!
Hi.
Hi.
I was gonna do that.
Yeah, well, I did it first.
That's good. What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.
I got sidetracked.
What's with the...
It's my disguise.
But I can see your face.
Not when I do this, you can't.
Your hair looks nice. I like what you did
with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?
What are those things on her eyes?
Are those people that she's killed?
She's so beautiful and strong
and courageous.
Who is this guy?
- He's a friend.
- Who? Me?
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you, too.
Look, I've spent years in a haze,
trying to forget my past.
Sakaar seemed like the best place
to drink and forget, and to die one day.
I was thinking that you drink too much,
and that probably was gonna kill you.
I don't plan to stop drinking.
But I don't wanna forget.
I can't turn away anymore,
so if I'm gonna die,
well, it may as well be driving my sword
through the heart of that murderous hag.
- Good.
- Yeah.
So, I'm saying
that I wanna be on the team.
Has it got a name?
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.
Revengers?
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.
Do you want revenge?
I'm undecided.
Okay.
Also, I've got a peace offering.
Surprise.
Just had to be sure.
Hello, Bruce.
So, last time I saw you,
you were trying to kill everybody.
Where are you at these days?
It varies from moment to moment.
Is that a Dragonfang?
It is.
My God.
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about as far
apart as any two known systems.
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard in 18 months.
Nope. We are going through the big one.
The Devil's Anus?
Anus?
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?
For the record, I didn't know
it was called that when I picked it.
That looks like
a collapsing neutron star
inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
We need another ship.
That will tear mine to pieces.
She's right. We need one that can
withstand the geodetic strain
from the singularity.
And has an offline
power steering system
that could also function
without the on board computer.
And we need one with cup holders,
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.
What do you say?
Uncharted metagalactic travel
through a volatile cosmic gateway.
Talk about an adventure.
- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.
There are one or two ships.
Absolute top of the line models...
I don't mean to impose...
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.
I may even have stolen the access codes
to his security system.
And suddenly you're overcome
with an urge to do the right thing.
Heavens, no.
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster,
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship,
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.
You're telling us that you can get us
access into the garage
without setting off any alarms?
Yes, brother. I can.
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.
He did try to kill me.
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.
There was one time
when we were children,
he transformed himself into a snake,
and he knows that I love snakes.
So, I went to pick up the snake
to admire it,
and he transformed back into himself
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.
If we're boosting a ship
we're gonna need to draw some guards
away from the palace.
Why not set the beast loose?
Shut up.
You guys have a beast?
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.
We're going to start a revolution.
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.
- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.
Is that some sort of protoplasm,
all the stuff that's coming out of you,
or are they eggs?
Looks like eggs.
I'm looking for Korg.
Who's asking?
I know you're asking.
Is there anyone else asking,
or is it just you?
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.
The revolution has begun.
Revolution? How did this happen?
Don't know.
But the arena's mainframe for the
Obedience Disks have been deactivated
and the slaves have armed themselves.
I don't like that word.
Which? Mainframe?
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?
No, the "S" word.
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.
Okay, that's better.
Hey, so, listen. We should talk.
I disagree.
Open communication
was never our family's forte.
You have no idea.
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.
Hello.
Hi.
Odin brought us together.
It's almost poetic that his death
should split us apart.
We might as well be strangers now.
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.
Here's the thing.
I'm probably better off staying here
on Sakaar.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Did you just agree with me?
Come on, this place is perfect for you.
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...
Brother, you're gonna do great here.
Do you truly think so little of me?
Loki, I thought the world of you.
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.
I don't know,
maybe there's still good in you.
But let's be honest,
our paths diverged a long time ago.
Yeah.
It's probably for the best
that we never see each other again.
It's what you always wanted.
Hey, let's do "Get Help."
- What?
- "Get Help."
No.
- Come on, you love it.
- I hate it.
- It's great. It works every time.
- It's humiliating.
- Do you have a better plan?
- No.
We're doing it.
We are not doing "Get Help."
Get help! Please!
My brother, he's dying.
Get help! Help him!
Classic.
Still hate it.
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?
The Commodore.
Right.
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.
Loki.
I know I've betrayed you many times
before,
but this time
it's truly nothing personal.
The reward for your capture
will set me up nicely.
Never one for sentiment, were you?
Easier to let it burn.
I agree.
That looks painful.
Dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.
I trust you, you betray me.
Round and round in circles we go.
See, Loki, life is about...
It's about growth.
It's about change.
But you seem to
just wanna stay the same.
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief,
but you could be more.
I'll just put this over here for you.
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck.
All right, I can figure this out.
It's just another spaceship.
Loyal Sakaarians,
Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship
and my favorite champion.
Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.
Do not let him leave this planet.
- Good shot!
- Thanks.
Open the doors.
Okay.
I hope that you're tougher
than you look.
Why?
Shouldn't we be shooting back
or something?
Yes, we should.
Where are the guns on this ship?
There aren't any.
- It's a leisure vessel.
- What?
Grandmaster uses it for his good times,
orgies and stuff.
Did she just say the Grandmaster
uses it for orgies?
Yeah.
Don't touch anything.
No!
- No!
- No!
Get inside!
In a minute.
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.
No. I don't know
how to fly one of these.
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.
None of them are for flying
alien spaceships!
Okay, come on.
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.
That looks like a gun.
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
Yeah!
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!
There she is.
Our ticket out of here.
Hey, what's this?
Thank you.
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.
You wanna come?
You do seem like you're
in desperate need of leadership.
Why, thank you.
Here we go.
Shit.
Asgardians...
Some misguided soul
has stolen the Bifrost sword.
Tell us where it is
or there will be consequences.
Bad ones.
Well?
You.
Well? Executioner?
Wait!
Wait!
I know where the sword is.
I never thought I'd be back here.
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.
I mean, not that it's not nice.
It's just, it's on fire.
Here, up here in the mountains.
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.
She's coming for them.
Okay, drop me off at the palace
and I'll draw her away.
And get yourself killed?
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.
While I'm dealing with Hela, I need you
two to help get everyone off Asgard.
How the hell are we supposed to do that?
I have a man on the ground.
Asgard.
She's here.
Now the ship has a gun.
I'll take it from here.
I found this in the armory.
Good luck.
Your Majesty...
Don't die.
You know what I mean.
We must keep moving!
Go to the Bifrost!
Sister.
You're still alive.
I love what you've done with the place.
Redecorating, I see.
It seems our father's solution
to every problem was to cover it up.
Or to cast it out.
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.
You see?
You never knew him.
Not at his best.
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations
in blood and tears.
Where do you think all this gold
came from?
And then, one day,
he decided to become a benevolent king.
To foster peace, to protect life.
To have you.
I understand why you're angry.
And you are my sister, and technically
have a claim to the throne.
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.
But it can't be you.
You're just the worst.
Okay, get up.
You're in my seat.
You know, Father once told me
that a wise king never seeks out war.
But must always be ready for it.
Go back!
Go!
To be honest, I expected more.
Heimdall!
The sword!
Here's the difference between us.
I'm Odin's firstborn,
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.
And you're nothing.
So simple,
even a blind man could see it.
Now you remind me of Dad.
The stupid dog won't die!
Everything's gonna be all right now.
I got this.
You wanted to know who I am?
What the hell are you talking about?
You'll see!
You see? No one's going anywhere.
I'll get that sword,
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.
Hey, man.
I'm Korg. This is Miek.
We're gonna jump on that spaceship
and get out of here. Wanna come?
Your savior is here.
Did you miss me?
Everyone, on that ship now.
Welcome home. I saw you coming.
Of course you did.
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.
You see...
I'm not a queen or a monster.
I'm the Goddess of Death.
What were you the god of, again?
Even when you had two eyes,
you'd see only half the picture.
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?
That hammer was to help you
control your power, to focus it.
It was never your source of strength.
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.
Asgard is not a place. Never was.
This could be Asgard.
Asgard is where our people stand.
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.
I'm not as strong as you.
No...
You're stronger.
Tell me, brother.
What were you the god of, again?
- You're late.
- You're missing an eye.
This isn't over.
I think we should disband the Revengers.
Hit her with a lightning blast.
I just hit her with the biggest lightning
blast in the history of lightning.
It did nothing.
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.
It won't end there.
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.
She'll hunt us down.
We need to stop her here and now.
So what do we do?
I'm not doing "Get Help."
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.
Loki,
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.
This was about causing Ragnarok.
Surtur's crown, the vault.
It's the only way.
Bold move, brother.
Even for me.
Shall we?
After you.
This is madness.
Go! Go, now!
For Asgard.
Hela!
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.
Hela, enough!
You want Asgard, it's yours.
Whatever game you're playing,
it won't work.
You can't defeat me.
No, I know.
But he can.
No.
Tremble before me, Asgard!
I am your reckoning!
The people are safe.
That's all that matters.
We're fulfilling the prophecy.
I hate this prophecy.
So do I, but we have no choice.
Surtur destroys Asgard,
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.
But we need to let him finish the job,
otherwise...
No!
Hulk, stop, you moron!
Hulk, stop.
Just for once in your life, don't smash.
Big monster!
Let's go!
Fine.
I am Asgard's doom!
The damage is not too bad.
As long as the foundations
are still strong,
we can rebuild this place.
It will become a haven
for all peoples and aliens
of the universe.
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.
What have I done?
You saved us from extinction.
Asgard is not a place...
It's a people.
It suits you.
Maybe you're not so bad after all,
brother.
Maybe not.
Thank you.
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.
I'm here.
Your throne.
So, King of Asgard.
Where to?
I'm not sure.
Any suggestions?
Miek, where are you from?
Miek's dead.
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him
on the bridge.
I've just felt so guilty,
I've been carrying him around all day.
Miek, you're alive!
He's alive, guys.
What was your question again, bro?
Earth it is.
Do you really think it's a good idea
to go back to Earth?
Yes, of course. The people of Earth
love me. I'm very popular.
Let me rephrase that.
Do you really think it's a good idea
to bring me back to Earth?
Probably not, to be honest.
I wouldn't worry, brother. I feel like
everything's gonna work out fine.
Oh, boy.
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!
Pat on the back.
Pat on the back.
Come on. No?
Me too.
'Cause I've been a big part of it.
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.
So, you're welcome.
And it's a tie.
The Tesseract has awakened.
It is on a neutral world, a human world.
They wield its power,
but our ally knows it's working, so that they never will learn.
He's ready to lead, and our force, our Chitauri will follow.
The world will be his and the universe yours.
And the humans, what can they do, but burn.
How bad is it?
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hour ago.
NASA didn't authorize Selvig to pull the test phase.
He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room. Spontaneous advancement
It just turned itself on?
What are the engine levels now?
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered the evac.
How long to get everyone out?
Campus should be clear in the next half hour.
Do better.
Sir, evacuation maybe futile.
We should tell them to go back to sleep?
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,
there may not be a minimum safe distance.
I need you to make sure that phase
Sir, is that really a priority right now?
Until such time as the world ends,
we will act as though it intends to spin on.
Clear out the tech below. Every piece of phase 2 on a truck and gone.
Yes, sir. Come with me.
Talk to me, Doctor.
- Director.
- Is there anything we know for certain?
- Tesseract is misbehaving.
- Is that supposed to be funny?
No, it's not funny at all.
The Tesseract is not only active, she's...misbehaving.
-How soon until you pull the plug?
She's an energy source.
If we turn off the power, she turns it back on.
- If she reaches peak level...
- We've prepared for this, doctor.
- Harnessing energy from space.
- We don't have the harness.
Our calculations are far from complete.
Now she's throwing off interference, radiation
Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.
That can be harmful.
Where's Agent Barton?
The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.
Agent Barton, report to me.
I gave you this detail so you could
keep a close eye on things.
- I can see better from a distance.
- Are you seeing anything that might
- set this thing off?
- Doctor, it's spiking again.
No one come or gone.
It's oven is clean.
No contacts, no I.M.'s.
If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.
- At this end?
- A cube of space, one end of the door.
Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides.
Sir, please put down the spear!
You have a heart.
Please don't.
- I still need that.
- This doesn't have to get any messier.
Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else.
I am Loki of Asgard,
- and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
- Loki, brother of Thor?
We have no quarrel with your people.
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.
- You planning to step on us?
- I come with glad tidings,
- of a world made free.
- Free from what?
Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.
Once you accept that, in your heart...
You will know peace.
Yeah, you say peace, I kind of
think you mean the other piece.
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.
This place is about to blow
Drop a hundred feet of raw material,
he means to bury us.
- Like The Pharaohs of Odin.
- He was right.
He's right, the portal is collapsing in on itself.
You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.
Drop him.
Need these vehicles.
- Who's that?
- He didn't tell me.
Hill, do you copy? Barton is....
He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
ets go, no no no.. leave leave, go.
We cleared upstairs, sir.
We need to go.
Director? Director Fury , do you copy?
The Tesseract is with the hostile force.
I have men down. Hill?
A lot of men still under,
don't know how many survivors.
Sound the general call,
I want every living soul not needing rescue
- looking for that briefcase.
- Roger that.
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a level seven.
As of right now, we are at war.
What do we do?
Subtitle By JAVANI
I do not want to end tonight.
I want to know how
for it to end.
Believe me, you must
to be better prepared.
Do you work?
Lermentoville?
Is he confident that we will do -
transport without him?
I thought that a General
Tchalakov handle exports.
Tchalakov. Running Boy, doll.
Outdated information
derived from the fall.
Famous Black Widow
it's just a pretty face.
Do I feel beautiful?
We do not need Lermentovia
transport tank.
Tell him that we give up
medium term by hand. It's true ...
You may have to write it down.
Yes?
You ask.
- Listen carefully ...
- Silenskin box 114, the third floor.
F-22 close to you 13 draw
kilometer radius.
Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby.
- We need you to come in.
- Are you kidding? I'm working!
- This takes precedence.
- I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this
moron is giving me everything.
I don't give everything.
- Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.
- Natasha.
Barton's been compromised.
Let me put you on hold.
- Where's Barton now?
- We don't know.
- But he's alive.
- We think so.
I'll brief you on everything when you get back.
But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts
me about as far as he can throw me.
No, I've got Stark. You get the big guy.
Oh, God.
- Do not come here!
- Who are you?
Go away. Here is a disease.
Are you a doctor?
My father did not wake up!
Body heat, and he
make noise, but did not open his eyes.
A slower rate.
My father ...
And when they?
Please...
Should have got paid up front, Banner.
You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress,
you picked a hell of a place to settle.
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
-Then what is it? Yoga?
ou brought me to the edge of the city, smart.
I uh...assume the whole place is surrounded?
Just you and me.
And your actress buddy, is she a spy too?
Do you start that young?
- I did.
- Who are you?
Natasha Romanoff.
Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?
Because that's not gonna work out for everyone.
No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD.
SHIELD. How did they find me?
We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance,
even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.
- Why?
- Nick Fury seems to trust you.
But now I need you to come in.
- What if I say no?
- I'll persuade you.
And what if the...other guy says no?
You've been more than a year without an incident.
I don't think you wanna break that streak.
I don't get every time what I want.
Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.
- Well, those I actively try to avoid.
- This is the
Tesseract.
It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
- What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?
- Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken.
It omits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.
There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.
If there was, that's where I'd be.
- So Fury isn't after the monster?
- Not that he's told me.
And he tells you everything?
- Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.
- He needs me in a cage?
- No one's gonna put you in a...
- Stop lying to me!
I'm sorry, that was mean.
I just wanted to see what you'd do.
Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that,
and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay?
Natasha.
Stand down. We're good here.
Just you and me?
This is out of line, Director.
You're dealing with forces you can't control.
You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight?
Did you feel an over abundance of control?
You saying that this Asgard has declared war on our planet?
Not Asgard. Loki.
He can't be working alone.
What about the other one? His brother.
Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile.
But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help either.
It's up to us.
Which is why you should be focusing on phase 2,
- it was designed for exactly...
- Phase 2 isn't ready, our enemy is.
- We need a response team.
- The Avengers Initiative was shut down.
- This isn't about The Avengers.
- We have seen the list.
We're running the world's greatest
covert security network
and you're gonna leave the fate of
human race to a handful of freaks.
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.
We need a response team.
These people may be isolated, unbalanced even,
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.
- You believe?
- War isn't won by sentiment, Director.
No, it's won by soldiers.
There's not enough time. I'm gotta
pull into the water.
- You wont be alone.
- .Oh God.
This guy is still alive.
Trouble sleeping?
I slept for 70 years, Sir.
I think I've had my fill.
Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.
I went under, the world was at war,
I wake up, they say we won.
They didn't say what we lost.
We've made some mistakes along the way.
Some very recently.
- You here with a mission, sir?
- I am.
- Trying to get me back in the world?
- Trying to save it.
Hydra's secret weapon.
Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you.
He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to
unlimited sustainable energy.
That's something the world sorely needs.
- Who took it from you?
- He's called Loki.
He's not from around here.
There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in.
The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.
Ten bucks says you're wrong.
There's a debriefing package waiting
for you back at your apartment.
Is there anything you can tell us
about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?
You should have left it in the ocean.
You're good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.
You disconnected the transition lines?
Are we off the grid?
Stark Towers is about to become a
beacon of self sustaining clean energy.
Wow, so maybe our reactor takes over
and it actually works?
I assume. Light her up.
- How does it look?
- Like Christmas, but with more...me.
Gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign.
You need to do some press.
I can do some more tomorrow,
I'm working on the zoning for the next billboards.
Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?
Enjoy the moment.
I remember.
Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line.
I'm not in. I'm actually out.
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.
Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.
Levels are holding steady...I think.
Of course they are, I was directly involved.
Which brings me to my next question.
- How does it feel to be a genius?
- Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I?
What do you mean? All this, came from you.
No. All this, came from that.
Give yourself some credit, please.
Stark Tower -
Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself, twelve percent of the credit.
- Twelve percent?
- An argument can be made for fifteen.
- Twelve percent for my baby?
- Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you.
- My private elevator.
- You mean our elevator?
It was teeming with sweaty workmen.
I'm going to pay for that comment about
percentages in some subtle way later on, aren't I?
Not gonna be that subtle.
I'll tell you what. Next building
is gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.
- On the lease.
- Call your mom, can you bunk over?
Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid
my protocol's are being overwritten.
Stark, we need to talk.
You have reached the life model
decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message.
- This is urgent.
- Then leave it urgently.
- Security breach. That's on you.
- Mr Stark.
- Phil! Come in.
- Phil.
- I can't stay.
- Uh...his first name is Agent.
- Come on in, we're celebrating.
- Which is why he can't stay.Soon as possible.
- I don't like being handed things
- That's alright, cause I love to be handed things.
So, let's trade.
Thank you.
Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
- This isn't a consultation.
- Is this about The Avengers?
- Which I...I know nothing about.
- The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought.
- And I didn't even qualify.
- I didn't know that either.
Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self obsessed, don't play well with others.
- That I did know.
- This isn't about personality profiles anymore.
- Whatever. Miss Potts, got a sec?
- You know, I thought we were having a moment.
- I was having twelve percent of a moment.
This seems so serious, Phil's pretty shaken.
- How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
- What is all this?
This is uh...
This.
- I'm going to take the jet to D.C. tonight.
- Tomorrow.
You have homework. You have a lot of homework.
Well, what if I didn't?
If you didn't?
You mean if you finished?
Then ...
Square deal. It's the last date.
Work hard.
- Do you drive past the airport, by chance?
- I can drop you.
Oh, fantastic. Does the cellist
You? Is it true relationship?
- He moved back to Portland.
- What?
We are a forty-minute
from the base, sir.
So this Dr. Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?
A lot of people were. You were the world's first superhero.
Banner thought gammer radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula.
- Didn't really go his way, did it?
- Not so much.
When he's got that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.
He's like a smart person.
I gotta say, it's an honor to meet you, officially.
I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping.
I mean, I was...I was present while you were unconscious from the ice.
You know, it's really, it's just a...just a huge honor to have you on board.
- Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.
- Oh, you are. Absolutely.
Uh...we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input.
The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little...old fashioned?
Everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light,
people might just need a little old fashioned.
- The Chitauri grow restless.
- Let them grow restless.
- I will lead them in the glorious battle.
- Battle? Against a meagre might of earth?
- Glorious, not lengthy.
If your force is as formidable as you claim.
You question us?
Question him?
He who put the scepter in your hand?
Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose?
When you were cast out, defeated!
I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard. Betrayed.
Your ambition is little and full of childish need.
We look beyond the earth to great worlds
The Tesseract will avail.
You don't have the Tesseract yet.
I don't threaten.
But until I open the doors,
until your force is mine to command, you are the wars.
- You will have your war as guardian.
If you fail, -
if the Tesseract is kept from us,
there will be no realm, no barren moon,
no crevasse where I can't find you.
You think you know pain?
You will receive something sweet as pain.
- Get your captain equipment.
- All right.
Agent Romanoff , he's Captain Rogers.
- They need you on the bridge.
- See you there.
There was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice.
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.
Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?
- Trading Cards?
- They're vintage, he's very proud.
Dr. Banner.
Oh, yeah. Hi.
- They told me you'd be coming.
- Word is you can find the cube.
- Is that the only word on me?
- Only word I care about.
Must be strange for you, all of this.
- Well, this is actually kind of familiar.
- Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute.
It's gonna get a little hard to breath.
Is this is a submarine?
Really? They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container?
Oh, no. This is much worse.
- All engine operating.SHEILD
emergency protocol,1 9 3.6 in effect. We're in, sir.
- Good.
- Lets vanish.
- Engage retro reflection panels.
- Reflection panels engaged.
- Gentlemen.
- Doctor, thank you for coming.
- Thanks for asking nicely.
- So, uh...how long am I staying?
- Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear.
Where are you with that?
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible camera on the planet.
Cell phones, laptops. If it's connected to a satellite,
- it's eyes and ears for us.
- That's still not gonna find them in time.
You have to narrow the field.
How many spectrometers do you have access to?
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know,
tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof
and calibrate them for gamma rays.
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition.
At least we could rule out a few places.
- Do you have somewhere for me to work?
- Agent Romanoff,
would you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please.
You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.
- Put over there.
- Is this the stuff you need?
- Yeah, Iridium.
It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons.
- It's very hard to get hold of
- Specially if SHIELD knows you need it.
Well, I didn't know!
The Tesseract is showing me so much.
It's...it's more than knowledge, it's truth.
I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?
- My next target.
- Tell me what you need.
I need a distraction.
And an eyeball.
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.
No, no. It's fine.
It's a vintage set.
It took me a couple of years to collect them all.
Near mint, slight foxing around the edges, but...
We got a hit. Sixty seven percent match.
Weight, cross match, seventy nine percent.
- Location?
- Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Canning Strasse.
- He's not exactly hiding.
- Captain,
you're up.
Kneel before me.
I said.
Kneel!
Is not this simpler?
Is this not your natural state?
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,
that you crave subjugation.
The bright lure of freedom diminishes
your life's joy in a mad scramble for power,
and identity.
You were made to be ruled.
In the end, you will always kneel.
Not to men like you.
- There are no men like me.
- There are always men like you.
Look to your elder, people.
Let him be an example.
You know, the last time I was in Germany
and saw a man standing above everybody else,
we ended up disagreeing.
I'm not the one who's out of time.
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
Kneel.
Not today!
The guy's all over the place.
Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?
Make your move, Reindeer names.
Good move.
- Mr Stark.
- Captain.
- Didn't he say anything?
- Not a word.
Just get in here.
We're low on time.
- I don't like it.
- What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
I don't remember it being that easy.
This guy packs a wallop.
Still, you were pretty spry, for an older fellow.
- What's your thing? Pilates?
- What?
It's like calisthenics.
You might have missed a couple things,
you know, doing time as a Capsicle.
- Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.
- Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.
Where's this coming from?
What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?
I'm not overly fond of what follows.
- Now there's that guy.
- Another Asgardian?
- Think the guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.
If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost.
- Stark, we need a plan of attack.
- I have a plan. Attack.
- I'd sit this one out, Cap.
- I don't see how I can.
These guys come from legends, they're basically Gods.
There's only one God, ma'am.
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
- Where's the Tesseract?
- I missed you too.
- Do I look to be in a gaming mood?
- Oh, you should thank me.
With the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy did the
All-Father have to muster to conjure you here?
Your precious earth.
I thought you dead.
Did you mourn?
- We all did.
Our father...
- Your father.
He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?
We were raised together.
We played together, we fought together.
- Do you remember none of that?
- I remember a shadows.
living in the shade of your greatness.
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.
- I who was and should be king!
- So you take the world I love as recompense for
your imagined slights?
No, the earth is under my protection, Loki.
And you're doing a marvelous job with that.
The humans slaughter each other in droves, while you ideally threat.
- I mean to rule them. That's why should I not...
- Think yourself above them.
- Well, yes.
- Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.
A throne would suit you ill.
I've seen worlds you've never known about.
I have grown, Odin's son, in my exile.
I have seen the true power of the Tesseract. And when I wield it...
Who showed you this power?
Who controls the would be king?
- I am the king!
- Not here!
You give up the Tesseract!
You give up this poisonous dream!
You come home.
I do not have it.
You need the cube to bring me home,
but I've sent it off. I know not where.
You listen well, brother.
I'm listening.
- Do not touch me again.
- Then don't take my stuff.
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
Uh...Shakespeare in the park.
Doth mother know, you weareth her drapes?
This is beyond you, metal man.
Loki will face Asgardian justice.
He gives up the cube and he's all yours. Until then,
stay out of the way.
Tourist.
Okay.
How about that.
Thats enough!
- Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.
- I've come here to put and end to Loki's schemes!
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.
Uh...yep! No! Bad call! He loves his hammer!
You want me to put the hammer down?
Are we done here?
In case it's unclear, you try to escape,
you so much as scratch that glass.
Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap.
You get how that works?
Ant.
Boot.
It's an impressive cage.
Not built, I think, for me.
Built for something a lot stronger than you.
Oh, I've heard.
The mindless beast, makes play to be the man.
How desperate are you? You call on these lost creatures to defend you.
How desperate am I?
You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control.
You talk about peace and you kill
cause it's fun.
You have made me very desperate.
You might not be glad that you did.
Ooh. It burns you to come so close.
To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power.
And for what?
A world for all mankind to share,
- and then to be reminded what real power is.
\- Well let me know if real power will want some magazine or something./
- He really grows on you, doesn't he?
- Loki's gonna drag this out.
- So, Thor, what's his play?
- He has an army called the Chitauri,
that none of Asgard nor any world know.
He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the earth.
- Return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.
- An army,
- from outer space.
- So he's building another portal.
- That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.
- Selvig?
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.
Loki has him under some kind of spell,
- along with one of ours.
- I wanna know why Loki let us take him.
- He's not leading an army from here.
- I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him.
I don't care how you speak.
Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother.
He killed eighty people in two days.
- He's adopted.
- I think its about the mechanics.
- Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?
- It's a stabilizing agent.
Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD.
No hard feelings Point Break, you've got a mean swing.
Also, it means the portal can open as wide,
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.
That man is playing gallaga.
Thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.
- How does Fury even see these?
- He turns.
Sounds exhausting.
The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.
Only major component he still needs is a power source.
A high energy density, something to kick start the cube.
When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?
Last night.
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the Extraction Theory papers.
Am I the only one who did the reading?
Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?
He got to heat the cube to a hundred and
twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.
Unless, Selvig has figured out how to
stabilize the quantum tunnelling effect.
Well, if he could do that he could achieve
Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.
Finally, someone who speaks English.
- Is that what just happened?
- It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.
You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled.
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control
and turn into an enormous green rage monster.
- Thanks.
- Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube.
- I was hoping you might join him.
- Let's start with that stick of his
It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a Hydra weapon.
I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube.
And I'd like to know how Loki used it to
turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.
- Monkeys? I do not understand.
- I do.
- I understood that reference.
- Shall we play it, Doctor?
- This way, Sir.
The gamma readings are definitely
consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract.
- But it's gonna take weeks to process.
- If we bypass their mainframe
and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster,
we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.
All I packed was a tooth brush.
You know, you should come by Stark Towers sometime.Top ten floors, all R and D.
- You'd love it, it's candy land.
- Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I
kind of broke Harlem.
Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension.
No surprises.
- Nothing?
- Are you nuts?
You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret?
- Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny.
- No offense, Doctor.
- No, it....it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't
- handle pointy things.
- You're tiptoeing, big man.
- You need to strut.
- And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.
You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now?
Why not before? What isn't he telling us.
I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.
- You think Fury's hiding something?
- He is a spy.
He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets.
It's bugging him too, isn't it?
- Uh, I just wanna finish my work here and...
- Doctor?
A world for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube.
- I heard it.
- Well, I think that was meant for you.
Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news.
The Stark Tower? That big ugly......, building in New York?
It's powered by Stark Reactors, self sustaining energy source.
- That building will run itself for what, a year?
- That's just the prototype.
I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.
So why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project?
I mean, What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?
I should probably look into that once my decryption programme finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.
- I'm sorry, did you say.....?
- Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.
In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide.
- Blueberry?
- Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?
An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically not possible.
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
This is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed.
We have orders, we should follow them.
Following is not really my style.
And you're all about style, aren't you?
Of the people in this room, which one is; a-wearing a spangly outfit, and b- not of use?
Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?
Just find the cube.
That's the guy my dad never shut up about?
Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.
The guy's not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us.
What he's got is an acme dynamite kit.
It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does..
And I'll read all about it.
Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.
Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.
I'm exposed, like a nerve.
- It's a nightmare.
- You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel,
trying every second to crawl its way into my heart.
This stops it. This little circle of light.
It's part of me now, not just armor.
- It's a terrible privilege.
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.
- It's different.
Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gammer exposure should have killed you.
So you're saying that the Hulk,
the other guy, saved my life?
That's nice.
It's a nice sentiment.
Save it for what?
I guess we'll find out.
- You may not enjoy that.
- You just might.
As soon as Loki took the doctor we moved Jane Foster.
We've got an excellent observatory in Traunsee.
She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.
Handsome fee, private plane, very remote.
- She'll be safe.
- Thank you.
It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig.
I dread what he plans for him once he's done.
- Erik is a good man.
- He talks about you a lot.
You changed his life.
- You changed everything around here.
- They were better as they were.
We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we.
We come here battling like Bilchsteim.
- Like what?
- Bilchsteim. You know; huge, scaly, big antlers.
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.
They are repulsive, and
they trample everything in their path.
When I first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price.
And now again,
n my youth I courted war.
War hasn't started yet.
You think you can make Loki tell us what the Tesseract is?
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield,
it's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance upon me.
There's no pain that would prise his need from him.
A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.
- What are you asking me to do?
- I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?
Loki is a prisoner.
Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?
There's not many people that can sneak up on me.
-But you figured I'd come after.
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,
you would appear as a friend,
as a balm.
- And I would cooperate.
- I wanna know what you've done to Agent Barton.
I'd say I've expanded his mind.
And once you've won. Once you're king of the mountain.
What happens to his mind?
- Is this love, Agent Romanoff?
- Love is for children. I owe him a debt.
Tell me.
Before I worked for SHIELD, I
I made a name for myself.
I have a very specific skillset.
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.
I got on SHIELD's radar in a bad way.
Agent Barton was sent to kill me,
he made a different call.
And what will you do if I vow to spare him?
- I'll not let you out.
- Ah, no. But I like this
Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man?
Regime's fall everyday.
I tend not to weep over that, I'm Russian,
Or I was.
- And what are you now?
- It's really not that complicated.
I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.
Can you?
Can you wipe out that much red?
Drakoff's daughter?
Sao Paulo?
The hospital file?
Barton told me everything.
Your ledger is dripping, it's gushing red,
and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything?
This is the basest sentimentality.
This is a child at prayer.
Pathetic.
You lie and kill
in the service of liars and killers.
You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,
something that makes up for the horrors.
But they are a part of you,
and they will never go away.
I won't barter Barton! Not until I make him kill you.
Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear.
And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work,
and when he screams I'll split his skull
This is my bargain, you mewling quin!
You're a monster.
Oh, no.
You brought the monster.
- So, Banner? That's your play?
- What?
Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way.
Set the door locked.
Thank you, for your cooperation.
- What are you doing, Mr. Stark?
- kind of been wondering the same thing about you
- You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.
- We are, the model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now.
When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.
And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss.
What is Phase 2?
Phase 2 is SHIELD used the cube to make weapons.
-Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow for me.
-Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.This does not
\ - mean that we're./
- I'm sorry, Nick.
What were you lying?
- I was wrong, Director. The world hasn't changed a bit.
- Do you know about this?
- You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?
- I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.
- Loki's manipulating you.
- And you've been doing what exactly?
- You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.
- Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.
I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.
Because of him.
- Me?
- Last year earth had a visitor from another planet
who had a grudge mass that levelled a small town.
We learned that not only are we not alone,
but we are hopelessly, hilariously
- out gunned.
- My people want nothing but peace with your planet.
But you're not the only people out there, are you?
And, you're not the only threat.
The world's filling up with people who can't be matched,
- they can't be controlled.
- Like you controlled the cube?
You're work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.
It is the signal to all the realms that the
earth is ready for a higher form of war.
- A higher form?
- You forced our hand.We had to come up with something.
A nuclear deterrent.
cause that always calms everything right down.
Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?
- I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck deep...
- Wait, Wait, Hold on. How is this now about me?
- I'm sorry, isn't everything?
- I thought humans were more evolved than this.
- Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?
- We can..
- You speak of control, yet you court chaos.
- It's his M.O., isn't it?
I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.
We're...we're a time-bomb.
- You need to step away.
- Why shouldn't they guy let off a little steam?
- You know damn well why! Back off!
- Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.
Yeah, big man in a suit of armor.
- Take that off, what are you?
- Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.
I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.
I've seen the footage.
The only thing you really fight for is yourself.
You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,
to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.
I think I would just cut the wire.
Always a way out.
You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero
A hero, like you?
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle.
Put on the suite, let's go a few rounds.
- You people are so petty, and tiny.
- Yes, right.
- Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr. Banner back to his
- Where? You're renting my room.
- The cell was just...
- In case you needed to kill me.
but you can't! I know, I tried.
I got low,
I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out.
So I moved on, I focused on helping other people.
I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show.
and put everyone here at risk. You wanna know my secret,
Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?
Dr. Banner.
put down the scepter.
All right.
- Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my party trick after all.
- Located the Tesseract?
- I can get there faster.
- The Tesseract belongs on Asgard,
- no human is a match for it.
- You're not going alone!
You gonna stop me?
Put on the suit, let's find out.
- I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
- Put on the suit.
Oh, my God.
- Put on the suit!
- Yep.
- Hill!
- Its a detonation. Number three engines is down.
-We're been hit.
-Fire engines.
- Talk to me.
- Turbine looks mostly intact, -
but it is impossible to get out there and repair when we already there.
If we lose one of engine we wont be.
- Someone gonna get outside and patch the engine.
- Stark, did you capy that?
- I'm on it.
Okay.
You okay right?
Keep that engine down.
Attention.wait the cameras going dark.
Stay close.
Level four.
Engine three. I'll meet you there.
Doctor.
Bruce, you gotta fight.
This is just what Loki wants.
We're gonna be okay. Listen to me.
We're gonna be okay. Right?
I swear on my life I will get you out of this,
you will walk away, and never...
Your life?
Bruce.
We have been carrying 180 to the south. Takes us to the water.
Free wind. Navigation
recalibration after the engine failure.
- Is the sun coming up?
- Yes sir.
Then put it on the left.
Takes us on the water.
One more turbine goes down
we're trapped.
Stark!
- Stark, I'm here!
- Good.
See what we got.
I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online
before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris.
I need you to get to that engine control panel
and tell me which relays are in overload position.
What's it look like in there?
It seems to run on some form of electricity.
Well, you're not wrong.
We're not your enemies, Banner.
Try to think.
The relays are intact.
- What's our next move?
- Even if I clear the rotors,
this thing won't re-engage without a jump.
- I'm gonna have to get in there and push.
- Well if that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded.
Then stay in the control unit and reverse
polarity long enough to disengage mag..
- Speak English.
See that red lever?
It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.
Stand by it, wait for my word.
I need full evac on lower deck.
Grenade.
We gotta perimeter breach.
Hostile wiped SHIELD gear.
Hulk and Thor are in the research level
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!
- Get his attention.
- Escorts, Six o proceed to the.
- Don't get too close.
Target acquired.
Target engaged.
Target in moving.
Engine now all shut down.
Sir we lost all engine one.
It's Barton. He took out our system.
He's headed for the detention lab.
Does anybody copy?
This is Agent Romanoff.I copy.
- Stark,we losing altitude.
- I have noticed.
No!
Are you ever not going to fall for that?
The humans think us immortal. Should we test that?
Move away please.
Do you like this?
We started working on the prototype after you sent The Destroyer.
Even I don't know what it does.
Do you wanna find out?
No!
Natasha ...
You're gonna lose.
Am I?
It's in your nature.
You're heroes are scattered,
your floating fortress falls from the sky.
- Where is my disadvantage?
- Your lack conviction.
I don't think I...
So that's what it does.
- Cap, need a lever.
- I need a minute here!
Lever, now!
I'm sorry, boss. They got rabbited.
Just stay awake. Eyes on me
- No, I'm clockin' out here
- Not an option.
It's okay, boss.
This was never gonna work if they didn't have something to.....
Agent Coulson is down.
- The medical team on the way to the location.
- They're here.
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.
Guess he never did get you to sign them.
We're dead in the air up here. Our communications,
location of the cube,
Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.
Lost my one good eye.
Maybe I had that coming.
Yes.
We were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.
I never put all my chips on that number though,
because I was playing something even riskier.
There was an idea, Stark knows this,
called The Avengers Initiative.
The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people,
see if they could become something more.
See if they could work together when we needed them to,
to fight the battles that we never could.
Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea,
in heroes.
Well, it's an old fashioned notion.
You fell out of the sky.
- Did I hurt anybody?
- There's nobody around here to get hurt.
You did scare the hell out of some pigeons though.
- Lucky.
- Or just good aim.
You were awake when you fell.
- You saw?
- The whole thing, right through the ceiling.
Big and green and buck ass nude.
Here...
I didn't think those would fit you until
you shrunk down to a regular size fella.
Thank you.
- Are you an alien?
- What?
- From outer space, an alien?
- No.
Well then, son. You've got a condition.
Clint, You're gonna be alright.
You know that? Is that what you know?
I got...I gotta go in though.
I gotta flush him out.
- We don't have that long, it's gonna take time.
- I don't understand.
Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?
Pull you out and send something else in?
Do you know what it's like to be unmade?
You know that I do.
Why am I back? How did you get him out?
Cognitive recalibration.
I hit you really hard in the head.
Thanks.
Natasha,
- how many agents?
- Don't. Don't do that to yourself, Clint.
This is Loki.
This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for.
- Loki, he got away?
- Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?
I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.
He's gonna make his play soon though. Today.
- We gotta stop him.
- Yeah? Who's we?
I don't know. Who's ever left.
Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's eye socket, I'd sleep better I suppose.
Now you sound like you.
But you don't.
You're a spy, not a soldier.
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?
What did Loki do to you?
He didn't, I just...
Natasha.
I've been compromised.
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.
- Was he married?
- No
He was a...cellist, I think.
I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.
- He was an idiot.
- Why? For believing?
- For taking on Loki alone.
- He was doing his job.
He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have...
- Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.
- Right. How did that work for him?
- Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?
- We're not soldiers!
- I'm not marching to Fury's fife.
- Neither am I.
He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does,
but right now we gotta put that behind us and get this done.
Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list...
He made it personal.
- That's not the point.
- That is the point. That's Loki's point.
- He hit us all right where we live. Why?
- To tear us apart.
He had to conquer his greed,
but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?
That's what he wants. He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.
- He wants an audience.
- Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.
Yeah. That's just previews, this is...
this is opening night. And Loki, he's a full-tail diva.
He wants flowers, he wants parades,
he wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered.
I hope that would be true.
- Time to go.
- Go where?
I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets?
I can.
You got a suit? Yeah.
Then suit up.
- You guys aren't authorized to be in here.
- Son, just don't.
Sir.
Done is jacket.
Ranugal
Ranugal
They needed to push.
They found it. Get our communications back up
whatever you have to do.
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes sir.
This device has already self sustainig.
- Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.
- It's too late.
It can't stop now.
He wants to show us something!
- A new universe.
- Okay.
The barrier is pure energy. It's unbreachable.
Yeah I get that.
Plan B.
- Sir, mark 7 is not ready for deployment.
- Then skip the spinning ring.We're run out of clock.
Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.
- Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten.
- You should have left your armor on for that.
Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.
You've got the blue stick of destiny.
- Stalling me won't change anything.
- No, no, no! Threatening.
The Chitauri are coming, nothing will change that.
- What have I to fear?
- The Avengers.
It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team.
Earth's Mightiest Heroes type of thing.
- Yes, I've met them.
- Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one.
But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend
a man with breath-taking anger management issues
a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella
you've managed to piss off every single one of them.
- That was the plan.
- Not a great plan.
When they come, and they will, they'll come for you.
- I have an army.
- We have a Hulk.
-I thought the beast had wandered off.
-You're missing the point. There's no throne,
there is no version of this, where you come out on top.
Maybe your army comes and
maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you.
Because if we can't protect the Earth,
you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.
How will your friends have time for me,
when they're so busy fighting you?
- It should work!
- Well, performance issues. You know?
Jarvis, anytime now.
- You will all fall before me.
And there's one other person you pissed off!
His name is Phil.
Right.
Army.
Loki, turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it!
You can't.
There is no stopping it.
- There is only the war!
- So be it.
- Stark, we're heading north east.
- What, did you stop for drive-through?
Swing that park, I'm gonna lay them out for you.
- So we have more incoming.
- Lets keep them occupied.
- Nat.
- Did you see them?
We need back up there.
- Stark, are you seeing this?
- I'm seeing, still working on believing..
- Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?
- Banner?
Just keep me posted.
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.
Look at this. Look around you.
You think this madness will end with your rule?
It's too late. It's too late to stop it.
No. We can, together.
Sentiment!
You got civilian trap in the roof.
Loki.
There more down there.
- We got this. Go Go.
- You think you can hold them off?
Captain,
it would be my genuine pleasure.
- Just like Budapest all over again!
- You and I remember Budapest very differently.
National guard?
Does the army know what's happening here?
Do we?
I need men in these buildings. There are people inside that can run into the line of fire.
You take them through the basement or through the subway, you keep them off the streets
- I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.
- Why the hell should I take orders from you?
I need men in those buildings, lead the people down and away from the streets
I wanna shut off the perimeter all the way down of 39 Street.
Well, we got its attention.
Where it heads to?
- Lets Thor hear what says.
- The powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable
Thor is right, we gotta deal with these guys.
- How do we do this? As a team.
- I have unfinished business with Loki.
- Yeah, get in line.
- Save it.
Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight focused on us and that's what we need. Without him these things could run wild.
We got Stark up top, he's gonna need us...
So, this all seems horrible.
- I've seen worse.
- Sorry.
No, we could use a little worse.
- Stark, we got him,
- Banne.
- just like you said.
- Tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.
I don't see how that's a party.
Dr. Banner,
Dr. Banner, now might be a good time for you to get angry.
That's my secret, Captain.
I'm always angry.
Hold on.
Send the rest.
Guys.
- Call it, Captain.
Alright, listen up. Until we can close that portal up there, we're gonna use containment.
Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays.
Stark, you got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or your turn it to ash.
- Wanna give me a lift?
- Right. Better clench up, Legoolas.
Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck that portal, slow them down.
You've got the lightning, light the bastards up.
You and me, we stay here on the ground, keep the fighting here. And
Hulk,
bSMASH/b
(Mean Hulk Smash, Grrr, like that ^^)
(so Fun, Hulk can understand now XoXoXo)
Sir.
Stark, you have a lot of
Strand out here.
- I try to keep them off the streets.
- But they cant bang with the them.
- Find the ....
- I will roger that.
Oh, boy.
Nice call, what else do you got?
We force taking out the squadron on 6.
And it didn't invite me.
Captain, none of this is gonna mean a damn thing if we don't close that portal.
- Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.- Well, maybe it's not about guns
You wanna get up there, you're gonna need a ride.
I could use a boost though.
- You sure about this?
- Yeah, it's gonna be fun.
Turn, turn.
This way.
Director Fury, the council has made a decision.
I recognize the council has made a decision,
but given that it's a stupid assed decision, I've elected to ignore it.
Director, you're closer than any of our subs, you scramble that jet
That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman.
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,
I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population.
If we don't hold them in the air, we lose everything.
I'd send that bird out, we already have.
Hawkeye.
- Nat, what are you doing?
- Little help.
I got him.
Enough!
You are all of you beneath me!
I am God,
you dull creature, and I will not be bullied by.
Puny God.
Doctor.
Loki's scepter, the energy...the Tesseract can't fight. You can't protect against yourself.
It's not your fault. You didn't know what you were doing.
Well, actually I think I did.
I built in a safety to cut the power source.
- Loki's scepter.
- It may be able to close the portal.
And I'm looking right at it.
Sir, we're losing power before penetrate that shell.
JARVIS, you hear
the Tell of Jonah?
I'm considering be a role model.
Director of Fury no longer responsible.
overwrite order 7-Alfa-1-1.
We are about to take off.
Sir we have born in motion.
Anyone on the deck?
We need to shut it down.
I repeat, take off not authorized.
Stark, do you hear me?
We have a missile headed straight for the city.
- How long?
- Three minutes, at best.
Stay load and wipe out them.
- Jarvis, put anything we got it.
- I just did.
The package is set. detonation in two
minutes and thirty seconds from now.
You ready for another bout?
What, you gettin' sleepy?
Right of to the front.
I can close it! Can anybody copy?
- I can shut the portal down!
- Do it!
- No, wait!
- Stark, these things are still coming!
I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute.
And I know just where to put it.
Stark, you know that's a one way trip.
- Save the rest for the turn jarvs.
- Shall I tray Miss Potts?
- Where her?
New York streets
has become a battleground.
The army is here, and try to contain
violence, but clearly
But the billionaire
Iron Man, Tony Stark ...
Come on, Stark.
Close it.
Son of a guy.
He's not slowing down.
What the hell?
What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me?
We won.
Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job
guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma?
There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.
- I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.
- We're not finished yet
And then shawarma after.
If it's all the same to you,
I'll have that drink now.
This point of devastation what has been confirmed extra terrestrial attack be a extraordinary a heroic group known as
Avengers has been.....
I love you, Thor!
Super hero in New York?
Give me a break!
These so called heroes have to be held responsible for the destruction done to the city.
This was their fight. Where are they now?
Captain America saved my life.
Whatever he is
and whatever any of them are i just
just want a say thank you.
- Where the Avengers?
- I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.
I'd say they'd earned a leave of absence.
- And the Tesseract?
- The Tesseract is where it belongs,
Out of our reach.
That's not your call.
I didn't make it.
So you let him take it and the war criminal, Loki,
who should be answering for his crime.
Oh, I think he will be.
I don't think you understand what you've started,
letting in The Avengers loose on some this world.
- They dangerous.
- They surely are,
and the whole world knows it. Every world knows it.
Was that the point in all this? A statement.
A promise.
How does it work now?
They've gone their separate ways,
some pretty extremely far.
We get into a situation like this again,
what happens then?
They'll come back.
- Are you really sure about that?
- I am.
- Why?
- Because we'll need them to.
- Mam.
- Hai.
Where do you find all these people?
SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor.
