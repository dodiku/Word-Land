# Word-Land

### How can human language be shaped into a virtual sculpture, a word land, through the help of machine language.

Word Land is a project created by [Yuli Cai](https://www.caiyuli.com/), from her formal work [Word Land Route](https://github.com/yulicai/NOC_Intelligence-Learning/tree/master/word_land_route). This time the approach of the land takes place from 2 dimensions to 3 demensions. It takes a corpus of text, which are movies scripts in the following examples, process them through machine learning(word2vec), and visualize them as a 3D sculpture living in the screen using three.js. 

<br /> 

**Two parts are covered in this project.**
1. Natural Language Processing(word2vec), 
2. Visualization of the words (three.js)

**The following technical parts will be covered in a workshop.**
1. Basic text data process with python.
2. Intro to word2vec, work with word2vec with python library Gensim
3. t-SNE with python, work with hi-dimensional data.
4. Basic introduction to THREE.js, an 3D web visual JavaScript library.
5. From text to 3D visualization.
